# Signal Tower Journal – Kaniss R.
*A quiet collection of reflections from the edge of Glenndale*

---

### Entry 01 – “Silk and Static”

> *"They left a drawing. Folded it twelve times and slid it under my trap coil panel.  
Crayons. Purple and blue arcs. Me — eight limbs.  
Said I protect them."*

> *"I reinforce perimeter nets. I prevent loss vectors. I’m not… a symbol."*

> *"...but I moved the panel. Left the drawing visible.  
Only that one."*

> *"And I upgraded his gloves.  
Light-dampening mesh. He won’t notice."*

> *"...It’s fine."*

### Entry 02 – “In The Way”

> *"He brought down two drones. Not with malice — with Void dust."*

> *"Said they startled the kids.  
Said I needed to ‘maybe not make them screech like banshees every 4.2 seconds.’"*

> *"I calibrate by range, not by scream."*

> *"But I… watched the kids sleep easier tonight. One of them brought out chalk. Drew a line around his doorstep.  
Called it a 'Zakk Zone.' Ridiculous."*

> *"Still.  
I reprogrammed Drone-7 and Drone-9 to hum instead of screech. Frequency: 326 Hz.  
Soothing. Measured. Effective."*

> *"He’s in the way.  
Not always the wrong way."*

### Entry 03 – “Stitched Notes”

> *"A child taped a note to the Spiderhouse gate today."*  
> *'Can we play tag if your traps don’t chase?'*

> *"I rewrote the Arc leash radius. Narrowed it 43%.*  
*Left three empty safe zones between the coils."*

> *"They played. They screamed. Not in fear — in joy."*

> *"I watched from the signal dish. Zakk waved.  
I did not wave back."*

> *"One of the kids came back after dusk.  
She left a stuffed ghost on the porch. Its eye was missing. Threadbare.  
I reinforced the seam. Returned it with upgraded padding."*

> *"The next day… she called it ‘Miss Webby.’"*

> *"...I accepted that."*

### Entry 04 – “The Festival Day”

> *"Glenndale held something they called a ‘lightfall day.’ Not related to the Collapse — something... celebratory."*  
> *"Colored paper. Firecrackers. Mismatched armor paints. Unstructured chaos. Children everywhere."*  
> *"I disabled 11 traps. Zakk tampered with three before I could get to them."*

> *"One girl asked if she could paint my Arc gauntlets.  
Said mine were ‘the color of sleep.’"*

> *"...I let her. She used violet, gold, and glowberry orange."*  
> *"It doesn’t wash off. I haven’t tried."*

### Entry 05 – “The Smile Question”

> *"A child — Jeyven, age 6 — asked why I never smile."*

> *"I told him facial expressions were not necessary for safety protocols."*

> *"He looked disappointed.  
Said ‘Zakk smiles, and he blows things up.’"*

> *"...I said nothing."*

> *"I later adjusted my helmet’s LED feedback loop to simulate soft facial curvature."*  
> *"I wore it near the Archive Tree. Jeyven nodded once."*

> *"I’ve only used it once.  
That was enough."*

---

### Entry 06 – “A Moment of Doubt”

> *"A breach occurred. Sector Three.  
Drone-2 failed to deploy its snare coil. My coil."*

> *"Zakk took the hit. Minor burns. He told the kid to run.  
Didn’t tell me until I saw his hand shaking while flipping that dumb coin."*

> *"I rewrote 137 lines of code. Stayed up four cycles.  
It wasn’t the drone’s fault."*

> *"He left a note:  
‘You fix things that aren’t broken. That’s how I know you care.’"*

> *"I burned it.  
Not before scanning it."*

### Entry 07 – “The Storm Evacuation”

> *"Atmospheric readings spiked. Void lightning across the ridgeline. Power dropout risk 94.2%."*

> *"I initiated Evacuation Protocol Theta.  
The kids hesitated. Some thought it was a game."*

> *"I used my voice.  
All of it."*

> *"They moved. Quickly."*

> *"One of the older ones, Lanar, asked why I sounded afraid.  
Said I usually sound like metal. Not… human."*

> *"I told him: 'Metal doesn’t panic. Humans do. I didn’t want to lose anyone.'"*

> *"After the storm passed, they returned to the Archive Tree.  
One left a drawing of me holding a lightning rod. It said:  
‘We followed the storm spider.’"*

> *"...I reinforced the base of the Archive Tree. Just in case."*

### Entry 08 – “The Hidden Memorial”

> *"I never noticed it before. Carved into the back roots of the Archive Tree, hidden under moss."*  
> *"Nine names. Small ones. Curved letters. Dates too short."*

> *"Old losses. From the early days.  
Before the traps. Before the structure."*

> *"There was a rusted cloth pin beside them — shaped like a threadling. Purple-dyed.  
I recognized the stitching."*

> *"Vanessa made these. I remember her smile when she gave me mine."*

> *"I repaired the pin. Left it there.  
Then I added a name: one I remembered from an early evac failure."*

> *"Not for glory. Not for records.  
Just… so someone knew they were worth being remembered."*
