---

**Dannie** falls asleep with one eye open.

**Vega** tells a sweet one. No one expected to cry.

They roll.  
It lands on *Explosion.*  
They cheer.  
The couch combusts. Everyone runs.

---

**Final Scene: Debrief**

Everyone’s outside in pajamas.  
The apartment is intact, somehow glowing with green flame.  
**Kapaar** salutes, throws a sparkler, and *jumps off the balcony yelling “BRAVOOOO-SEVEEEEEEN!”*

Silence.

**Kaniss**: “I’m banning him from the power grid.”

**Zakk**: “He reset my sarcasm reserves. I’m… speechless.”
