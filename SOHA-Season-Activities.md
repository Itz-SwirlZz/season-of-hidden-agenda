# Seasonal Activities Overview  
**Section:** Hidden Agenda > Core Activities  

The *Season of Hidden Agenda* introduces three unique activity modes beyond the raid and dungeon—each reflecting the season’s deeper themes of surveillance, deception, and fractured identity. These activities provide Guardians with intense replay value, layered challenges, and rare lore-bearing rewards.

---

### 1. Culling Grounds *(PvEvP Mode – set on Gliese)*

- A spiritual successor to Gambit, but darker and more survival-focused.  
- Two fireteams enter mirrored arenas and **compete by slaying enemies**, managing corruption levels, and **triggering sabotage invasions** against one another.
- Players can **summon elite Hive distortions** to invade the enemy team’s map.
- Allowing more Hive corruption empowers your fireteam but also increases the risk of triggering a **Rootless Overgrowth**—a catastrophic entity that can wipe both teams.
- Designed as the **season’s proving ground for control and moral pressure**.

---

### 2. Echo Bounty *(PvE Mode – Tactical Bounties in Lost Zones)*

- Fireteams are dispatched across Gliese and beyond to track and eliminate **Disguised Echoes**—Hive entities mimicking local NPCs or environments.
- Missions feature dynamic modifiers:
  - **Silent Memory** – disables the HUD
  - **False Light** – one teammate unknowingly works against the team
  - **Eclipsed Timer** – objectives completed too quickly increase enemy aggression
- Rewards include **exotic crafting materials** and **lore fragments** tied to Kezen’s psyche or redacted H.I.L.T. entries.
- Prioritizes deception, investigation, and psychological warfare.

---

### 3. Blackwire Protocol *(PvE Mode – Node Defense + Interference)*

- Guardians defend Gliese-based **data pylons** while **intercepting Hive conjuring signals** in real time.
- A hybrid of tower defense and zone control mechanics.
- **Multiple fireteams may enter**, but only one can stabilize each node wave and secure the reward.
- The longer the fireteam survives, the more **Kezen’s whispers** distort gameplay:
  - False objectives
  - Enemy mirages
  - Visual glitches and echoing ambient dialogue
- Rewards scale with survival streaks and completion precision.

---

## Activity: Culling Grounds  
**Type:** PvEvP Hybrid  
**Location:** Gliese – Ruptured Biomes  
**Match Size:** 2 teams of 3  
**Unlocked After:** Completing the Chamber of Trials once

---

# Culling Grounds

**Culling Grounds** is a brutal, high-stakes activity where two fireteams compete in mirrored arenas corrupted by Hive influence. Both teams race to slay enemies, collect **Unstable Charges**, and bank them to **summon Hive-rooted distortions**—either to empower their own arena or sabotage their opponents.

This mode is a **chaotic tug-of-war** between containment and escalation.

---

### Core Mechanics

- **Unstable Charges:** Dropped from elite Hive foes. Used to fuel arena control or trigger enemy interference.
- **Corruption Meter:** Increases with every charge banked or if enemies linger. A full meter will summon an uncontrollable Hive entity called the **Rootless Overgrowth**—a wipe risk for both teams.
- **Distortion Invasions:** Spend charges to summon a Hive distortion to attack the opposing team’s arena (e.g., a Taken-style Knight, a soul-chained Shrieker, or a mind-controlled Thrall wave).
- **Split Victory Paths:**
  - **Containment Win:** Survive five waves without corruption reaching 100%.
  - **Domination Win:** Defeat the opposing team’s Rootless Overgrowth after sabotaging their meter.

---

### Unique Modifiers (Rotating Weekly)

- **Memory Lock:** One player on each team loses all HUD elements.
- **Hive Inheritance:** Damage over time persists across rounds.
- **Disruption Field:** Abilities randomly trigger their cooldowns if charged for too long.

---

### Heroic Mode

Unlocked after your first clear. Heroic Culling Grounds features:
- **Harder sabotage waves** and limited banking windows
- **Legend-tier Hive distortions** as invaders
- **Neutral Exotic Drop Pool Unlocks** via Ritual Alignments

**Ritual Alignment Drops (examples):**
- *Nötivart’s Galaxy* – Finish without summoning any invasions
- *Baylanard’s Sheathe* – Finish while maintaining meter under 33% the entire time

---

### Notes

- Culling Grounds is the **only PvEvP mode** in Hidden Agenda, designed to reflect the blurred lines of trust, power, and sabotage.
- It serves as the **seasonal proving ground** for control under pressure—and control of one's morality.

---

# Echo Bounty  
**Type:** PvE – Tactical Bounties  
**Location:** Gliese (Lost Zones, Derelict Biomes, Forgotten Structures)  
**Match Size:** 3-player fireteam  
**Unlocked After:** Completing the Chamber of Trials OR first successful dungeon clear

---

### Overview

**Echo Bounty** tasks fireteams with tracking and eliminating **Disguised Echoes**—Hive entities capable of mimicking fallen Guardians, villagers, or environmental objects. These Echoes are often tethered to **psychic residuals**, and must be located through layered clues, surveillance distortion, and **behavioral profiling**.

Each mission zone contains **one true target**, a Disguised Echo hiding in plain sight. Others are decoys—or worse, **adaptive traps**.

---

### Core Mechanics

- **Surveillance Layer:** Players are given fragments of a distorted transmission at the start of the mission. These function as partial leads, requiring exploration of the zone for audio-visual clues.
- **Behavior Tags:** Disguised Echoes exhibit subtle inconsistencies—non-looping dialogue, incorrect reaction patterns, or Hive glyph “flickers.”
- **Echo Shattering:** Once identified, an Echo must be weakened and then shattered using a **custom artifact** (provided during the mission).
- **If the wrong target is shattered**, the Echo adapts, and the zone destabilizes—triggering **False Response Protocols** (trap rooms, memory reversals, or field scrambling).

---

### Randomized Modifiers

Each Echo Bounty loadout comes with 1–2 of the following random conditions:

- **Silent Memory** – Disables all HUD, map, and teammate markers. Forces visual-based coordination.
- **False Light** – One player is unknowingly flagged by the Hive and becomes a liability unless cleansed. They may cause distortions passively.
- **Eclipsed Timer** – Completing objectives too quickly increases Hive aggression and Echo reinforcement density.
- **Conjurer's Gambit** – Echoes emit decoy transmissions; only one clue per scan is true.
- **Fractured Ground** – Heavy stomping or Arc-based damage causes terrain collapses and area shifts.

---

### Heroic Mode

Unlocked upon completing 3 standard bounties.  
Heroic Echo Bounties feature:
- **Multiple Disguised Echoes**, only one of which is tethered to a relic
- Stronger environmental instability and phase-shifting zones
- Heroic-only Echo variants that **mimic dead fireteam members**
- Higher drop rates for exotic crafting materials

**Ritual Alignment Rewards:**
- *Baylanard’s Satchel* – Complete a bounty with perfect accuracy and zero failed IDs  
- *Acuras Abliteris* – Complete a bounty without using your Super or class ability  
- *Immunitive Greaves* – Cleanse the False Light marker without the marked player being downed

---

### Narrative Role

Echo Bounty operations are authorized by remnants of the Vanguard and newly formed **Neutral Dispatch Orders**. These bounties are directly tied to:
- **Kezen’s fragmenting influence across Gliese**
- **Recovered nodes from Glennstone and Baylanard’s mechanical failsafes**
- **The Hollow Star alignment theory**—where Void energy carries grief echoes across timelines

---

### Summary

- **Focus:** Identification, isolation, and purification of corrupted echoes
- **Themes:** Deception, isolation, suspicion, and misdirection
- **Activity Identity:** Echo Bounty exists to remind Guardians that **not everything Hive-born is visible**, and **not every threat screams its arrival**.

---

# Blackwire Protocol  
**Type:** PvE – Node Defense / Interference Hybrid  
**Location:** Gliese – Neural Relay Outposts  
**Match Size:** 3-player fireteam (public fireteams may overlap temporarily)  
**Unlocked After:** Completing one Echo Bounty or discovering a relay anomaly in the wild

---

### Overview

**Blackwire Protocol** is a defensive activity that blends **tower defense, control point tactics, and psychic warfare**. Fireteams must stabilize vulnerable Gliese-based **data pylons** while **disrupting Hive conjuring rituals** that attempt to hijack the network through quantum interference.

Each node successfully defended pushes back the Hive’s presence in the relay system—but also deepens **Kezen’s feedback imprint**, increasing instability.

This is a test of **endurance, synchronization, and sanity**.

---

### Core Mechanics

- **Gliese Nodes:** These unstable relay towers emit radiant pulses. Guardians must remain within the control zone while:
  - Charging the node  
  - Preventing Hive ritualists from seeding conjuring glyphs  
  - Maintaining energy flow by **intercepting corrupted pulses**

- **Disruption Pylons:** Secondary pylons spawn with energy caps. Players must **manually disrupt them** before they reach overload (causing terrain debuffs or spawn changes).

- **Feedback Threshold:** Each successful wave increases the node’s instability by 5–10%. Once the instability reaches 70% or higher, Kezen’s presence becomes visible via glitch effects, ghost voices, or memory loops.

---

### Activity Flow

1. **Node Activation** – Players defend the node while deciphering incoming code pulses.
2. **Hive Glyph Rush** – Hive attempt to overwrite control. Prevent glyph anchors from locking in.
3. **Disruption Phase** – Corrupted pylons activate in random locations. Split to interrupt them in time.
4. **Wave Escalation** – Survive increasing pressure while monitoring **instability meters**.
5. **Kezen Manifestation (Heroic Only)** – A distorted projection of Kezen emerges and warps the arena briefly with reality shift events.

---

### Heroic Mode

Unlocked after stabilizing 3 different node types.

Heroic Blackwire Protocol features:
- **Multiple node sites** active at once  
- **Cross-arena conjuring interference**, where one ritual affects another node
- Elite Hive enemies with distortion auras (phase delay zones)
- Visual HUD interference and lore glitch triggers

**Ritual Alignment Drops (examples):**
- *Brute of Baylanard* – Stabilize 3 nodes without node health dropping below 50%  
- *Baylanard’s Will* – Complete the activity with no failed pylons  
- *Nötivart’s Galaxy* – Complete with 100% instability but no Guardian deaths

---

### Kezen’s Influence

At instability levels above 66%, fireteams begin to hear **glitched Hive prayers**, fragments of **Kezen’s journals**, or even **false mission updates**. These are not just flavor—they hint at secrets across the activity and into the dungeon.

> “She rewrites the script. Even when no one's watching.”

---

### Summary

- **Focus:** Reactive defense, perception under pressure, chaos management
- **Themes:** Information war, psychic decay, false certainty
- **Activity Identity:** Blackwire Protocol pushes Guardians to **hold the line when nothing around them stays still**—when even the mission itself may be lying.
