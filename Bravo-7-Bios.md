# **Yerk “Talladega” Vega – The Dice Roller**
![Yerk.png](/assets/Yerk.png)
**Species**: Human | **Origin**: Irish
**Eyes**: Hazel-green, w/ flecks that brighten under stress
**Role**: Recon & Strategy
**Class**: Hunter (Arc)
**Ghost**: Cross – The Gambler’s Lens

Yerk Vega calculates fate like it’s a chessboard wired to a dice tower. Hailing from the legacy-rich Black Clover Industries, his upbringing mixed firearms innovation with quiet pressure to be perfect. Instead, Vega chose calculated chaos—luck with rules, chance with preparation.
Despite his smooth wit and gambler persona, Vega is a tactician at heart. Every fireteam run, every enemy callout, every retreat is one more move in a game he’s always simulating. He never plays to win for himself. He plays to lose the right way, if that means the others live.
He's emotionally guarded but team-obsessed. He'll take a bullet if the numbers say it buys time. And he’ll smile doing it, dice in his palm, already planning the next move.

**Notable Quote**:
>*“If the mission goes to hell, make sure they blame me. I calculated it that way.”*

**Core Bonds**:

• Harlo-9: Saved and rebuilt him—treats Harlo’s well-being like a moral algorithm.

• Vanessa: Teases her more than most, but quietly reads her journal margins when she’s not looking.

• Zakk: Sees him as a wild card—dangerous, but full of potential.

**Trivia**:

• Never rolls a die without logging the result. Cross keeps a running table.

• Refuses to wear cloaks with clean hems. Says it “throws off the numbers.”



# **Harlo-9 – The Rebuilt Shield**
![Harlo.png](/assets/Harlo.png)
**Species**: Exo | **Class**: Titan (Solar)
**Role**: Engineer & Support
**Ghost**: Gidjitt – The Sync Spark

Harlo-9 isn’t loud. He doesn’t need to be. His presence hums with quiet precision—every plate of his sleek armor a testament to both Vega’s faith and his own handiwork. Dug out of scrap and darkness, Harlo wasn’t just repaired—he was revived. By Vega’s hand. By purpose.
Underneath that polished exterior is a soul tuned for care. Harlo watches for signs the others won’t admit: Zakk’s faltering focus, Vanessa’s shaky hands, Kaniss’s tightened grip on her gloves. He doesn’t ask. He just builds.
His gadgets—clean, efficient, and always field-tested—are inspired by his Exo friend Baylanard, and his sense of duty often outpaces his own safety protocols. He sees protection not as a function, but as his reason for being.

**Signature Tech**:
• Watcher Thermite System – precision-triggered Solar grenades
• Sensor mesh mines with programmable detonation
• Light-reflective armor plates to guide fireteam movement under pressure
Notable Quote:
“If I’m not there to block it… then I failed to plan for it.”

**Bond Highlights**:
• Vega: The one who rebuilt him. Their silence is shared understanding.

• Gidjitt: Harlo talks to her like she’s his conscience.

• Baylanard: Long-distance engineering peer. They rarely speak, but swap upgrade notes in code.

**Armor Aesthetic**:
Smooth matte panels with hidden burn-scar seams—battle scars turned intentional design. Every part serves a function, and nothing is wasted. Harlo-9 is the plan.




# **Vanessa Winterfield – The 8-Legged Promise**
![Vanessa.png](/assets/Vanessa.png)
![Vanessa2.png](/assets/Vanessa2.png)
**Species**: Awoken | **Eyes**: Bright Blue (Emotion-Reactive)
**Class**: Warlock (Strand – Broodweaver)
**Role**: Crowd Control & Emotional Anchor
**Ghost**: Pipp – The Whisper in the Heart

Vanessa doesn’t fight like a Warlock. She flows. Every gesture, every pulse of Strand weaves a story—one stitched with intuition, loyalty, and softly named threadlings she treats like kin. She once called them “tiny intentions.” And like her octopus necklace, each is a promise made physical.
The necklace is a family heirloom. But Vanessa made it hers—learning to craft duplicates in quiet moments, gifting them to those her gut says will matter. Her accuracy in sensing trust is uncanny. Even clumsy or chaotic, she feels truth like a sixth sense.
Her journals are endless. Sometimes poetic, sometimes technical, sometimes just raw bursts of emotion scrawled between missions. Pipp logs beside her, adding notes, sketches, and riddles in the margins.
Though bright and vocal, Vanessa hides deeper wells of grief and guilt—often smiling so others don’t break. She teases Kaniss, out-talks Vega, hugs Zakk when no one else knows he needs it. In many ways, she is Bravo-7’s gravity.

**Combat Style**:

• Commands swarms of threadlings named like pets—"Milo," "Skritch," "Button," and more.

• Anchors large fights with webbed control and unpredictable entanglements.

• Her eyes shift hue with emotion—pink for joy, violet for grief, red for fury.
Notable Quote:
“A thread’s just a maybe… until you tie it to someone.”

**Trivia**:

• Her combat pouch holds ink, quills, a paper roll, and backup necklace fragments.

• Once thread-bonded a Hive Knight by accident. He knelt. Pipp still teases her for it.

• Her room smells like worn books and lavender-spiced wiring.

***Emotion-Based Eye Color Shifts***

Vanessa's default eye color is bright blue, but in moments of heightened emotion, her irises shift in hue—like emotional weather you can see:

• *Pink* – Excited, affectionate, or creatively inspired

• *Red* – Angry, protective, or when channeling raw power

• *Green* – Deep intuition, thoughtful curiosity, or quiet admiration

• *Purple/Violet* – Sadness, empathy, or overwhelming memory

• *Gold/Amber* – Determined focus or spiritual clarity (rare moments)

Her eyes don’t always change instantly—some shifts take time, others burst like a flare depending on intensity. Zakk once joked that she’s a walking RGB display. She responded by writing that exact phrase in her journal… with glitter ink.



# **Kaniss Romletté – The Arc Arachnid**
![Kaniss.png](/assets/Kaniss.png)
**Species**: Human | **Eyes**: Deep Blue
**Origin**: French

**Region**: Glenndale
“Most don’t even know she sleeps in the Signal Tower. It’s better that way.”

**Class**: Warlock (Arc – Custom Subclass: Webweaver)
**Role**: Control & Crowd Entrapment
**Ghost**: Zinnatrix “Zin” – The Silk Circuit

Kaniss doesn’t command the storm. She designs it.
Through her custom subclass—Arc Webweaver—Kaniss bends Light into spider-like constructs: traps, tethers, and static fields that hunt with mathematical grace. She doesn’t cast spells; she structures threats. Each arcline is placed with the same thought a spider gives to a single strand.

Her combat style mirrors her emotional life: focused, contained, and intricate. She rarely speaks unless necessary, preferring actions, glyphs, and perfectly timed lightning. Emotion for Kaniss isn’t verbal—it’s voltage.

With long, wavy blonde hair and a scar from an Arc misfire trailing down her right eye, Kaniss’s presence is both striking and unyielding. Her armor is cyber-gothic, shaded in dark gray with blue accents like flickers of webbed electricity. Everything she wears and builds follows function. Even her silence feels engineered.

**Signature Behavior**:
• Logs real-world spider species and mimics their traits in Arc-based constructs
• Uses Zinnatrix’s predictive sync to trigger web traps without a word
• Calms nervous team members through mechanical tuning or gesture-based responses

**Notable Quote**:

“Spiders don’t weave chaos. They design consequence.”

**Tactical Design Notes**:

• Arc traps that mimic net-casting spiders
• Tether nodes that triangulate based on prey movement
• Arc grenades that hum a warning before chaining lightning in silk-like bursts

**Trivia**:

• Has personally catalogued over 80 spider species in a side journal (the Golden Silk Orb Weavers are her favorite, she has a pet one!)

• Once designed a trap so elegant that Vanessa wrote it a poem

• Only laughs when no one is watching—but Zin logs the timestamp anyway

# Zakk Romletté - The Void Prodigy 
![Zakk.png](/assets/Zakk.png)
**Species**: Human | **Eyes**: Deep Blue
**Origin**: French

**Region**: Both
“The only person banned from both Devrim’s tower and the Glennstone rail loop.”

**Class**: Warlock (Void – Custom Subclass: Void Sculptor)
**Role**: Flank Master & Field Manipulation
**Ghost**: Vriss – The Void Echo

Zakk Romletté doesn’t walk into fights. He shapes them.
As a Void Sculptor, Zakk bends the battlefield like a stage—casting armor, blades, and warps of distortion with mischievous precision. Where Kaniss designs traps, Zakk breaks patterns. He weaponizes unpredictability. And he’s very proud of it.

He grew up idolizing the elusive Nötivart—the “Void King”—and has trained obsessively to forge his own legacy. While Kaniss builds structure, Zakk cuts escape routes. While she logs species, he launches purple smoke bombs from spider-bots and yells “flavor tech!” mid-fight.

With a blond curly undercut and sharp eyes always scanning for angles, Zakk’s style is part rogue, part performer. His armor glows with bright purple over light gray—every line chosen for show and strategy.

**Signature Combat Behavior**:
• Void-shapes defensive armor and stealth-based paths
• Launches “flavor bombs” (non-lethal Void bursts) to misdirect
• Teases enemies over comms mid-fight, often while already behind them

**Notable Quote**:
“I’m not dramatic. I’m Void-flavored.”

**Sibling Dynamic**:

• Constantly competes with Kaniss

• Claims he’s “more efficient,” while secretly stealing her trap schematics to improve his own

• Would never admit it, but seeing her take damage makes him reckless

**Trivia**:

• Calls his smoke-bot “Flop” and is training it to “teleport then sass”

• Vriss once declared Zakk’s Void signature as “too spicy for precision,” and Zakk agreed

• Once tried to surf a collapsing gravity well just to see if it was possible. It was... barely.



# **“Daring” Dannie Garcia – The Rare Daredevil**
![Dannie.png](/assets/Dannie.png)
**Species**: Human | **Eyes**: Light Brown

**Origin**: Earth (Glennstone
“When she left, she took her ramp blueprints with her. The kids remade them. Bigger.”

**Class**: Hunter (Solar – Blade Barrage)
**Role**: Instinctual Vanguard & Symbol of Courage
**Ghost**: Quasie – The Wild Static

You don’t always see Dannie Garcia coming—but you always feel the ripple when she’s been there.

A legendary daredevil and performer-turned-Guardian, Dannie blazed her name across the stars with explosive stunts, untouchable sparrow acrobatics, and battlefield dives that made Firebreak Titans flinch. She co-founded a stunt and racing company with Amanda Holliday before Holliday's death, and still runs it today—juggling the chaos of showtime with calls to duty.

Garcia doesn’t linger on words. Her presence says enough. She’s the reason Vega first picked up a knife, why Harlo built tools with flair, and why Vanessa dares to lead with her heart.
When she does arrive, she burns bright. Fast. Unshakable. You never have to ask where she’s going—just whether you can keep up.

**Combat Signature**:

• Uses Blade Barrage mid-motion—her explosions never come from a standstill

• Disorients with mobility and misdirection; plays like a storm, not a soldier

• Known to leap off ledges just to spark dramatic re-entry

**Notable Quote**:

“You don’t dare the fall. You dare the rise.”
(One of the few lines caught on a comms recording.)

**Visual Design**:

• Lean athletic build, dressed for movement

• Armor scuffed from crashes she laughs about

• Sparking visor helmet clipped to her side at all times (the one Vega keeps in backup storage)

**Trivia**:

• Quasie once rode a lightning bolt across the Divalian Mist just because.
• Garcia’s stunt record—“5 flips, 2 sparrow slingshots, 1 mid-air Blade Barrage finish”—is still unbeaten.
• She’s rumored to have turned down multiple Vanguard promotions.
