## Relevance to the Hidden Agenda  
The planetary structure of Gliese 581c mirrors the ongoing moral, elemental, and factional tension at the heart of the Season of Hidden Agenda. The Guardian presence on Gliese is focused around its **Goldilocks zone**, nicknamed **Twilight Mantle**, where survival is possible — but fragile.

The planet is divided into:

### **1. Scorchlight Reach (Day Side)**  
A volatile zone constantly bombarded with stellar radiation. Solar constructs twist here. Anything that burns, burns *forever*.

### **2. Twilight Mantle (Habitable Belt)**  
The center of operations and the only known area where both flora and Light-based tech can stably coexist. The Flowergroves of Pistillum are rooted here.

### **3. Umbral Deep (Night Side)**  
An irradiated void-scape with cracked ice plains and buried Hive altars. Thought to be Nötivart’s final battleground.

## Scientific Notes  
- **Atmospheric Conditions:** Hypothetically possible to support liquid water in the habitable belt if the atmosphere is thick enough to redistribute heat  
- **Surface Gravity:** Estimated ~1.5g (stronger than Earth) — explains the high durability required of all Guardian gear in this zone  
- **Magnetic Flux Zones:** Void storms and aurorae affect ghost signal consistency in night-facing areas

## Vanguard Designation:  
**Gliese-581c // OpCode: NIGHTBLOOM**

All Guardian operations require environmental seals, alternating light calibration, and full fireteam registration due to signal occlusion risk in the Umbral Deep.
