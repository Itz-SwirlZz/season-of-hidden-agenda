# Voidnotes: Zakk R.
*A record of the quiet shadows between sarcasm, trust, and something close to home.*

---

### Entry 01 – “Staring Contest”

> *"You ever try to have a staring contest with someone who’s constantly watching motion sensors?  
You lose. Every time."*

> *"I tried anyway. Kaniss was perched on the signal tower — her favorite haunted gargoyle impression. She didn’t blink once."*

> *"I blinked twice, waved, and got the usual: cold silence and the sound of something arc-charged recalibrating just for me."*

> *"She doesn’t hate me. I checked.  
Hate requires more acknowledgment."*

> *"But she leaves gifts for kids. Fixed a jump line the other day before anyone noticed.  
And that one time the storm hit Glenndale?  
She was the first one yelling — only time I’ve seen her shout."*

> *"That’s why I do it. Not to bother her — well, not *only* to bother her.  
It’s the little cracks.  
Every once in a while, they glow."*

> *"I don't stare to win. I stare to remind her someone sees."*

### Entry 02 – “Conversations with Vriss”

> *"Vriss won’t shut up lately. Not out loud — in that quiet way Ghosts have when they’re judging you without blinking."*

> *"‘You know, Zakk,’ he says, ‘she doesn’t need you to fix her.’"*  
> *"And I say: ‘I’m not trying to. I just… rewire things nearby. Coincidentally.’"*

> *"He clicks. I hate when he clicks. It’s the ‘you’re doing the thing again’ noise."*

> *"Truth is, I don’t fix her.  
But I *do* recalibrate tripmines she forgets to check."*

> *"Not because I think she’ll get hurt.  
Because I know she wouldn’t care if she did."*

> *"And that scares me more than the mines ever could."*

### Entry 03 – “Are You Her Brother?”

> *"A kid in Glenndale asked me if I was Kaniss’s brother."*  
> *"Said we had ‘the same sharp eyes.’"*  
> *"Which is weird, because mine are obviously better."*

> *"I told her no. Then I hesitated and said ‘kind of.’  
And then I gave her a Void coin. Told her it could bounce off light and find its way home."*

> *"She tried it. It landed in mud. She said ‘it doesn’t work.’"*  
> *"I said, ‘It’s a metaphor.’"*  
> *"She said, ‘Is that like lying but fancier?’"*

> *"...I told her yeah."*

> *"She still kept the coin."*

### Entry 04 – “Go Tell Her”

> *"They dared me to tell her. A bunch of Glenndale kids with sticky hands and zero impulse control."*  
> *“Go tell the Spider Lady you like her!” one yelled.  
Another added, “Bet you won’t!”*

> *They don’t know I’ve died before.  
But this? This felt worse.*

> *So I walked up the slope. She was recalibrating the Archive Tree perimeter again — hadn’t looked up once in three hours. I stood there and just… watched the coil glow.*

> *I said, ‘Hey, Kaniss?’*  
> She didn’t answer. She just clicked something into place. So I tried again.*  
> *‘Hypothetically — very hypothetically — if someone liked you, would you, uh… trip them less?’*

> *She finally looked at me. Blinked once. Then said:  
‘Depends. Are they clumsy, or just asking for it?’*

> *And then she turned back to her panel like it never happened.*

> *I laughed. Too loud. Almost got zapped on the way down.*

> *I don’t think I failed.  
But I don’t think I won either.*  
> *Which is very us.*

### Entry 05 – “Don’t Write This Down”

> *"Vanessa caught me sitting on top of the water tower."*  
> *"She didn’t say hi — she just threw a snack bar at my head and said, ‘You're too quiet. What broke?’"*

> *I told her nothing.  
Which is how she knew something was up.*

> *She sat beside me, kicking her feet like a kid on a ledge. Then she pulled out her journal and said, ‘This is going in the log unless you talk.’*

> *So I said:  
‘I like Glenndale. Not because it’s safe. Because it’s messy, but people *try.*’*

> *She smiled. Not the normal bright one — the *real* one. Quiet, like she knew the storm was calm for a second.*

> *Then she wrote anyway.  
I said, ‘Don’t write that down.’*

> *She said, ‘Already did. Page header: “Zakk feels stuff, and it’s weird.”’*

> *I said I hate her. She said, ‘No you don’t.’*

> *I don’t.*

### Entry 06 – “She Didn’t Mean To”

> *"I was rerouting a Void capacitor around the Spiderhouse — not snooping. Just fixing. Probably improving, if we’re being honest."*

> *I slipped under the old vent port. That’s when I saw it — half-tucked under a folded cloth, half-exposed.*

> *A drawing.  
Crayon lines. Threadling arms.  
Me.*  
> *Standing next to her.*  
> *No trap coils. Just the Archive Tree behind us. And the words:  
‘Safe is when he’s here.’*

> *She didn’t mean to leave it out.  
She wouldn’t.*  
> *And I didn’t take it. Didn’t even touch it.*

> *Just looked at it.  
Then walked out like I hadn’t seen anything.*  
> *Like it wasn’t the most dangerous thing I’d ever stumbled into.*

> *I didn’t log anything else after that.*  
> *Didn’t need to.*
