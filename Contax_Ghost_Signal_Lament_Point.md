# Contax Mission Log – Ghost Signal at Lament Point

## Mission Brief – “Ghost Signal at Lament Point”
**Status:** Active  
**Assigned Team:** Contax  
**Location:** Verdant Grave – Subsurface Zone V-9 ("Lament Point")  
**Access Level:** Seal Break Required – Pistillum-Originated  
**Objective:** Trace origin of anomalous Golden Age signal; secure or neutralize.

### Transcript – War-Tactical (Soren Vell)
> "Signal lock confirmed. The call sign embedded in the ping predates the Collapse. Location: 900m underground. No known Guardian path."
> 
> "We’re the only ones who can reach it. And the only ones who shouldn’t."

### Special Circumstance
- Signal contains synthetic echo signatures resembling **Pistillum’s voiceprint**
- Area locked via **Floral Seal**—an organic encryption system believed extinct
- Potential link to abandoned research on **Soulstate compression**
- Caution advised: Emotional distortions detected in initial scout ping

---

### Notable Risk Factors
- Psychological destabilization events logged in environmental scan
- Ghosts report interference when trying to phase near the signal source
- Memory bleed may occur—expect hallucinations, looping dialogue, false-positive threats

---

### Authorization Override:
**Contax Only**  
Proceed with all six members. No reinforcements.
