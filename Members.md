# Pistillum – The Flower-Fed Wrath

Goddess of the Flower Fields / Former Warden of the Black Garden

*"She was not reborn. She re-rooted."*
*A guardian made an art piece based on what they saw when they were worthy to meet Pistillum:*
![Pistillum.png](/assets/Pistillum.png)
*Pistillum’s exotics are in the "Verdant Grave Exotics" Tab.*

Pistillum once presided over the wild beauty of the Black Garden, not as a god or queen, but as a guardian of balance. She did not resist when the Vex came—not at first. She observed, mourned, and left. But exile did not kill her. It hardened her. Sharpened her.

Now, in the sanctuary she calls the Flower Fields, she rewards those who respect nature—and punishes those who do not. She is beauty with teeth. Wrath with petals. Grace and grief, wrapped in vines.

# Baylanard – The Quiet Forgemind

*"Limelight makes armor look thin. So I stay in the shade."*
![Baylanard.png](/assets/Baylanard.png)
A lesser-known Exo gunsmith, Baylanard is known for his heavy-plated weaponry and functional design philosophy. He has avoided the fame of Banshee-44—though they are close. His past remains unclear, especially his reboot history. He rarely talks, and only truly opens up to his trusted ally Harlo-9.

Baylanard doesn’t seek approval. He respects purpose. If you earn his trust, it’s not through words, but through what you survive.

## Baylanard Exotics

### Lore Tab – Baylanard’s Will

> "Remember, Guardian: the target is who's inside the armor, not the armor itself."  
> —Baylanard

To most, armor is the threat.  
Baylanard disagrees. Armor can be replaced. Plates can be patched. Shields break.

But the **will** behind the weapon? That’s what matters.

Baylanard’s Will isn’t just a firearm. It’s a declaration of focus. A weapon tuned to ignore distractions, swap tactics on instinct, and **cut through the noise**—whether by storm or silence.

Arc pulse for the reckless.  
Void auto for the relentless.  
Either way, every kill leaves behind something electric.  
A reminder. A mark. A message.

The armor doesn’t matter.  
The Guardian holding the trigger?  
**They do.**

### Brute Of Baylanard
Exotic Power Sniper (Solar)

Rounds overpenetrate targets and explode.

**Exotic** - ***Volatile Triple Tap***

*Timed Payload*

### Lore Tab – Brute of Baylanard

> "Yeah, it's one of my projects.  
> Who inspired me?  
> Well, the Contax Team."  
> —Baylanard

They weren’t Titans.  
They weren’t even conventional.  
But they fought with a kind of brutal *clarity*—no hesitation, no half-measures. That left an impression on Baylanard. Not their finesse, but their **intent**.

So he built a weapon that did the same:  
**Strike through. Then blow through what’s behind it.**

The Brute doesn’t just land precision shots. It demands them. And when it hits that third one, it doesn’t whisper victory—it **erupts**.

Some Guardians ask if it’s overkill.  
Baylanard’s only reply is a smirk, a shrug, and:  
> “Depends who’s behind the first guy.”

### Immunitive Greaves

![Immune.jpg](/assets/Immune.jpg)

**Armor Catalyst**

Damage to gun sheild partially reloads held weapon.

### Lore Tab – Immunitive Greaves

> "You are the wall. No one can move, change, or force the way you are."  
> —Baylanard

Other Guardians dodge.  
Baylanard plants his feet.

To him, mobility was a myth sold to the reckless. He believed that **endurance**, not evasion, is what outlasts a war. And the ones who refuse to fall—who dig in, even when it hurts—those are the Guardians worth remembering.

The Immunitive Greaves weren’t just engineered for resistance. They were sculpted around a truth Baylanard learned the hard way:

If you stand long enough, you stop being a target.  
You become the terrain.

The one-way gun shield isn’t a barrier. It’s a statement.  
And you? You’re the damn punctuation mark.

### Baylanard's Sheathe
Exotic Titan Helm
Bio: "I find it surprising that the simplest piece of protection is not used for guardians: Sheathes." -Baylanard
![Sheathe.jpg](/assets/Sheathe.jpg)
**Exotic** - ***Metal Bunker***
Ward of dawn is replaced with an igloo-like structure with a firing visor. Back door let's allies in and keeps enemies out.

**Armor Catalyst**
Pieces of the iron bunker falling off creates orbs of power. Kills through the firing visor creates orbs.

### Lore Tab – Baylanard’s Sheathe

> "I find it surprising that the simplest piece of protection is not used for Guardians: Sheathes."  
> —Baylanard

He didn't mean sword sheaths. He meant armor sheaths — modular, heavy, reliable layers meant to *shield* a Guardian before they even think about raising one.

For Baylanard, the bubble wasn’t enough. It was a statement, sure — a radiant wall of safety. But it left too many blind spots, too many assumptions.

So he built something else.

An ironwrought dome with one purpose: shelter the trusted, shut out the rest. With a rear entrance to usher allies through and a visor to push power forward, the **Sheathe** is less a helmet and more a **command post**.

Inside it, you're not just defending the Light.  
You're declaring it won't fall on your watch.

# Nötivart – The Void King

*"In the void between stars, he found his purpose—not in light, nor in darkness, but in the silence that binds them."*
![Notivart.png](/assets/Notivart.png)
Nötivart is more myth than man. A figure known for his presence during the Gliese War, and for his eerie neutrality. He is neither Light nor Dark, Hive nor Vanguard. He is something else. Something older. Something absent.

His presence disrupts certainty. His words fracture meaning. And when he fights, the cosmos listens. Also referenced as "The Hollow Star".

## Nötivart Exotics
## Exotic Weapon – Acuras Albliteris
![Acuras.jpg](/assets/Acuras.jpg)
**Type:** Void Pulse Rifle  
**Frame:** Delay Frame (Custom Variant)
First reactive shot, followed by 2 higher damaging bullets in a burst.

**Exotic Trait – *Grave Etching*:**  
While Enchanted, kills trigger shrieker death blasts that track targets. Death blast kills give extra super energy.

**Passive – *Son of Mortis*:**  
After 2 rapid precision kills, the weapon becomes Enchanted for 6 seconds: repeated hits cause weaken.

**Catalyst – *Lineage Vector*:**  
- Increases stability and reload speed    
- Grants partial ability energy when defeating weakened enemies

**Bio:**  
There is something etched on this weapon: **“Son of Mortis.”**

**Lore Tab:**  
> “There’s another hint that will take a while to decipher.”  
> “I have some analysis on this saying—there's a relative that was associated with this weapon, and they have some correlation to Nova Mortis.”  
> “Hmm, interesting...”  
> “According to my analysis on the catalyst, it is said that there were three known Void-Savvy Guardians who wielded powerful Void weapons.”  
> “...Go on.”  
> “The third guardian happens to be under the name of *Nötivart.* And his ideal weapon of choice? A greatsword… in the look of a Hive Knight blade, but more sleek in design. Strange...”  
> “Yes, strange indeed...”  
—Guardian and Ghost

## Exotic Weapon – Nötivart’s Galaxy
![GALAXY.jpg](/assets/GALAXY.jpg)
**Type:** Void Sword  
**Frame:** Heavy Cleaver Frame (Custom Hive Greatsword)  

**Exotic Trait – *Fracture Point*:**  
Landing three consecutive light attacks causes the next heavy to leave a lingering void rupture that pulses for 6 seconds, weakening enemies caught inside.

**Passive – *Void King’s Reign*:**  
When surrounded by three or more enemies, sword charge decays slower, and all heavy slams apply Volatile. Sword guards deflect minor projectiles while active.

**Catalyst – *Celestial Split*:**  
- Blocking reflects projectiles. Consumes more ammo if projectiles are void.  
- Charged slam creates an implosion that pulls targets inward before the rupture  

**Bio:**  
> "...Not only that, a handful of people must slam the sword at the same spot to unleash..."  
—Last transmission of Nötivart, The Void King

**Lore Tab:**  
> “To unleash... unleash what?”  
> “I don’t know. If we can find the missing two segments of the transmission, I could possibly put 2 and 2 together. All that we have is: 1, 2, 4, 5, and 7.”  
> “There’s not much to work with other than shooting for its catalyst. Maybe there’s more to it than we’ve thought.”  
> “Indeed. *Nötivart* is a very shy person when it comes to his belongings; most people that do see his arsenal tend to be no less than amazed.”  
> “With a Hive/hand-crafted Void-infused greatsword like this, I don’t blame them...”  
—Guardian and Ghost
