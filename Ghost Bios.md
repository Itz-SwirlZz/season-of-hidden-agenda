**Companions of Bravo-7**

# Cross – The Gambler’s Lens

*Ghost of Yerk “Talladega” Vega*

Cross speaks with a smooth, calculated voice like a man running numbers in the back of his head. He doesn’t gamble—he *analyzes*. Every move, every breath, every twitch of Vega’s hand is recorded, tagged, and stored in a mental archive Cross updates obsessively.


He once hacked a Fallen encryption key by comparing it to ancient chess moves and bad poker hands. When asked how, he simply said, “Statistics.”


Cross plays devil’s advocate in mission plans, often challenging Vega’s quiet resolve with probabilities Vega pretends not to care about. But make no mistake—Cross is the only one who sees when Vega’s hands shake. And he steadies them.



# Pipp – The Whisper in the Heart

*Ghost of Vanessa Winterfield*

Pipp is gentle, humorous, and speaks in riddles. She believes in the emotional weight of things—names, trinkets, and stories. She catalogues everything Vanessa writes, often adding her own poetic footnotes and commentary.


Where Vanessa jokes to cope, Pipp comforts to reveal. She has a voice like old wind chimes and a knack for calming even the loudest storm.


Pipp refers to herself as a “memory weaver,” always encouraging Vanessa to “write it down” when things get heavy. No Guardian has ever caught her scanning a battlefield—but her scans always finish before the shooting stops.



# Zinnatrix “Zin” – The Silk Circuit

*Ghost of Kaniss Romletté*

Zin doesn’t speak much—when she does, it’s in threads of logic so tightly knit that others often miss the meaning until it’s too late. She syncs directly with Kaniss’s neural impulses during combat, allowing spider-trap deployment without a single spoken word.


Zin studies patterns obsessively—weather, enemy habits, migration patterns of wildlife. She claims the world is just a "web waiting to be read."


Kaniss doesn’t mind Zin’s silence. They’re two halves of the same arc strand: silent, deadly, and impossibly intricate. Zin often leaves little glyphs etched into charging stations and armor plates—no one but Kaniss understands them.



# Vriss – The Void Echo

Ghost of Zakk Romletté

Vriss talks fast. Always. Like he's afraid the silence will swallow him. He’s chaotic, clever, and sometimes too sarcastic for his own safety, especially around Zin. He idolizes Nötivart almost as much as Zakk does and quotes obscure Voidwalker sermons mid-fight.


Unlike most Ghosts, Vriss takes joy in field ops—he calls it “void surfing.” He rides through the dark like a bird on thermals, pinging signals and glitching sensors just to show off.


He's also fiercely loyal. When Zakk’s confidence cracks (and it does, despite his swagger), Vriss gets quieter. Simpler. Real. “Hey,” he says. “You got this. Because I chose you.”



# Quasie – The Wild Static

*Ghost of “Daring” Dannie Garcia*

Quasie is energy in a box. A jittering, fast-talking blur of commentary who sounds like a late-night radio host hopped up on pure Light. She doesn’t believe in “calculations”—only instincts, gut calls, and “going loud.”


No one knows how she keeps up with Garcia, but she does—and *loves* every second of it. Her shell is always scuffed, and one of her plates glows neon for no reason she’s willing to explain.


Quasie once launched herself at a Hive Knight mid-battle because she thought he “looked like he needed a podcast.” She has a catchphrase: *“Dare to glitch.”* And somehow… it fits.
