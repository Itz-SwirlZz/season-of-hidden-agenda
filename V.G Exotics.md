Dungeon Exotics – Verdant Grave

Each weapon grown from the Flower Fields carries more than petals—it carries intent. Every pull of the trigger says something about who you are, and Pistillum made sure the garden will remember it.

>“Pistil’s Grace is the featured drop of the Verdant Grave dungeon, tied to player behavior and ritual precision.”

**Passive Trait** – Pistil’s Anger:
Swap between Arc & Kinetic-Burst mode. Kinetic burst shoots 2 rounds per burst

**Exotic Trait** – Pistil Whip:
Arc mode kills Makes clouds that release confusion effects (foes attack each other/pvp friendly fire is enabled). Kinetic-Burst gains Timed Payload on repeated hits.


**Lore Tab**:
She didn’t believe in aimless beauty.
Grace, to Pistillum, was the art of striking when it matters.
When she fired the first charged round from this rifle, the impact sowed blooms where the enemy fell—an arc field of petals and madness.

The others thought it was decoration.
Until their allies walked into it and turned on each other.
Until the garden fed itself.

“Life is dependent on what you will do,” she had written.
And with this?
She wrote sermons in thunderclaps.

## Pistil’s Mercy

**Type**: Exotic Kinetic Sidearm

**Flavor Text**: “You stand on your own free will; Will you stay there is the question.”
![MERCY.jpg](/assets/MERCY.jpg)
**Passive Trait** – Rooted Rounds:
Precision and fall-on damage increase for all other weapons when this one runs dry.

**Exotic Trait** – Lifesteal Rounds:
Body shots randomly return health. After 3–4 headshots, health return is guaranteed.


**Lore Tab**:
She did not beg the wind to stop. She bent, but did not break. She stood in a field of ash and dared to breathe. Pistillum forged this weapon for those who refuse to run. It is not made for the coward or the conqueror, but for the rooted—those who stay. The lifeblood of her field flows through each shot. And when your back is to the wall, and your clip runs dry, she rewards you for enduring.
Mercy, to her, was never weakness. It was the strength to hold the line… and to heal while doing so.

## Pistil’s Coherence

**Type**: Exotic Solar Auto Rifle

**Flavor Text**: “What are these markings, you say? Checkpoints… checkpoints of our success.”
![COHERENCE.jpg](/assets/COHERENCE.jpg)
**Passive Trait** – Pistil’s Anger:
Delay charge before firing in full auto.
Has a heating up system

**Exotic Trait** – Calm Down:
Precision kills drop firebolt grenades. Continued heat buildup scorches enemies and slightly boosts weapon damage when max. Headshot Kills in this state cause grenade spread.


**Lore Tab**:
The first time she marked a tree, it was to track the seasons. The second, to mourn a fallen friend. By the time the Vex came, the grove was covered in glyphs.
The Bouquet Leader called them checkpoints. Signs of victory.
But Pistillum knew better.
They weren’t progress—they were pressure points. Wounds. Waiting. Heating.

This weapon is not for the reckless—it’s for the intentional.
Burn long enough, and you’ll ignite more than the field.
You’ll start a language of flame.
One even the flowers understand.

## Pistil’s Gambit

**Type**: Exotic Void Machine Gun

**Flavor Text**: “Roses are red, violets are blue…”
![GAMBIT.jpg](/assets/GAMBIT.jpg)
**Passive Trait** – Pistil’s Anger:
Charge time before full auto.
Gains Dragonfly.

**Exotic Trait** – Pistil’s Generation:
Repeated hits split projectiles. Kills spawn Spores that boost charge rate when near.


**Lore Tab**:
The page is torn.
The poem incomplete.
That’s how she left it.

Pistillum believed in potential. In evolution.
In endings that fracture into beginnings.
‘Roses are red, violets are blue…’ She stopped there.
Not out of forgetfulness—but out of mercy.

Let the rest be written by those who survive her garden.
Let them finish the rhyme…
if they live long enough to find the next page.
