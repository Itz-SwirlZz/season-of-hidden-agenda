## Chamber of Trails – Brief Encounter Overview

A grief-scarred Hive ritual site buried beneath Gliese, haunted by echoes of H.I.L.T. Each encounter tests not only strength—but memory, restraint, and the ability to carry the pain of others.

---

---

### Encounter II – Kapaar: Furnace Trial
- Rotate between safe zones to avoid heat stacks.

---

### Encounter IV – Harth’noak: The Mourning Bomb
- Maintain his emotional Pressure Threshold with Remnants of Calm.
- Suppress cursed Thralls before detonations.
- Defusal Runes phase leads to a one-Guardian choice: end his life or offer peace.
- Redemption: Perform Emote Failsafe if grief surges. If peace is chosen with the Remnant, Harth’noak is saved.

---

### Final Encounter – Kezen: The Undermind of Regret
- Match glyph relics and defeat Shadow of Regret beneath the correct rune in Shadow Realm.
- Defeat returning H.I.L.T. phantoms in a mirrored battle phase.
- Reflect Soul Pulses and free Memory-Locked Guardians during collapse.

# Detailed Raid Mechanics

Chamber of Trails – Full Raid Guide (Detailed Version)

Overview

The Chamber of Trials is the raid featured in Season of Hidden Agenda, focusing on the remnants and regrets of the H.I.L.T. fireteam. Set in a Hive-infested soulspace, Guardians must confront echoing memories, psychological mechanics, and moral crossroads.


---
## Encounter I – Kiln Auga’thuun: The Silent Foundation

**Arena:**  
A collapsed Hive sanctuary beneath Gliese. The chamber features three dormant Hive runes and a solemn, circular arena surrounded by broken monoliths and ritual carvings. The silence feels ceremonial.

**Opening Visual:**  
Kiln Auga’thuun kneels at the center of the room, cleavers stabbed into the ground at his sides. He does not react to the fireteam’s presence until the first rune is disturbed.

---

### Phase I – The Foundation Trial _(Sample Rune Test)_

- One of the three Hive runes activates at random.
- Guardians must slay Oathbound Knights to collect **Seismic Shards** and deposit them into the active rune.
- Once deposited, Kiln releases an **Oath Pulse** – a wave of void energy. **All Guardians must remain completely still**.
- **Failure to remain still causes Kiln to single out and instantly kill the offending Guardian** with a single cleave.
- Upon failure, Kiln **shakes his head** in disappointment and returns to roaming the arena silently.
- If a Guardian fumbles positioning at a rune **before** the Oath Pulse, Kiln performs one punishing strike, then resumes pacing.
- Only one rune is tested in this phase—serving as a preview for what’s to come.

---

### Phase II – Silent Judgment _(True Ritual Phase)_

- All three Hive runes activate.
- Guardians must stand in each rune simultaneously.
- Kiln returns to the center and kneels.
- A synchronized Oath Pulse triggers across the entire arena.
- **All three players must remain completely motionless inside their respective runes.**
- **Any movement or misstep results in an immediate wipe.**

> Upon success: Kiln rises, turns his back to the fireteam, and **slashes open the sealed wall behind him** with both cleavers.  
> A new chamber is revealed. A timer begins—**all Guardians must enter the arena before the passage seals**.  
> **Any Guardian who dies or misses the window is locked out permanently.**

---

### Phase III – Final Stand: The Cracked Foundation

- Inside the final chamber, Kiln becomes fully aggressive.
- Combat abilities:
  - **Void Tracking Cleaves** – Boomerang-like, homing axe throws.
  - **Staggering Strikes** – Suppresses class abilities on hit.
  - **Cleaver Sync Slam** – Kiln fuses both axes and attempts an arena-wide wipe.

> **Wipe Mechanic Visual Cue:** Kiln’s **head begins to glow violet**.  
> Guardians must focus damage on the head to **interrupt the wipe**.  
> Failure results in: *“The Foundation cracked beneath your feet.”*

- **Any Guardian who dies during Phase III is permanently locked out** for the remainder of the encounter.

---

### Challenge Mode – Unbroken Line

> No Guardian may die or be incapacitated by Oath Pulse or movement errors throughout the encounter.

**Reward:** Shield Ornament – _Silent Conviction_
Completing challenge as titan unlocks exotic "Toxins Spist" @ Kezen's Encounter.

---

### Redemption Detail – Duel of Equals

If the fireteam completes all phases perfectly (no deaths, no failed pulses, all enter final chamber):

- Before the final fight, Kiln **kneels once more**, planting one cleaver into the ground and acknowledging the team with a silent pause.
- During Final Stand, Kiln **does not perform the Cleaver Sync Slam**.  
  The wipe mechanic is removed entirely—his duel is now **one of respect**, not punishment.

---

## Encounter II – Kapaar: Furnace Trial

**Arena:**  
A volatile Hive boiler facility deep beneath Gliese. The structure groans with shifting heat vents, exposed pressure valves, and flickering hazard lights. The air is thick with smoke and volatile soulfire gas.

**Opening Visual:**  
As the team enters, the floor shakes. **Kapaar crashes down** from a grated catwalk, dragging his custom flamethrower *Gospel*. He growls through his helmet:

> “Hot enough for regret?”

He laughs, igniting the vents around him as the battle begins.

---

### Phase I – Pressure Zones

- Rotating **heat zones** glow red across the arena floor.
- Guardians must continuously rotate between **safe zones** to avoid gaining stacks of **Burning Pressure** (death at Tier 3).
- **Thermal Charges** drop from Incendiary Thralls and must be thrown into **fuel cores** to open sealed doors and progress.
- Standing still or straying too long in a hot zone causes an explosion and scorches the team.

---

### Phase II – Vent Calibration

- Teams split between two roles:
  - One reroutes pressure via **Override Switches** to control steam paths.
  - The other delivers **Thermal Charges** to overheated cores under a time limit.
- Failed deliveries cause **Soulflare Eruptions**, which flood half the arena with deadly heat.
- Team coordination and zone memory are essential.

---

### Final Phase – Kapaar Unleashed

- Kapaar enters the active arena with *Gospel*, fully enraged.
- The arena’s heat zones rotate continuously.
- New mechanics include:
  - **Soulfire Spirals** – Sweeping fire beams in rotational patterns.
  - **Pressure Chain** – Overexposed Guardians are marked and targeted with chain-scorch lunges.
  - **Blister Charge** – At 66% and 33% health, Kapaar vents pressure and dashes at the farthest Guardian, scorching terrain in a straight line.

> The entire phase is a chaotic test of movement, cooldown use, and space management.

---

### Wipe Mechanic

> *“You played with fire.”*  
Triggered if all Guardians are caught in heat zones simultaneously or if **three fuel deliveries fail** during the encounter.

---

### Challenge Mode – Controlled Combustion

> No Guardian can remain in any heat zone for longer than 2 seconds.

**Reward:** Flame Glow – _Blistershine_

---

### Redemption Detail – Cooling Point

If all of the following conditions are met before **Kapaar reaches 33% health**:

- No Guardian has more than **Tier 1 scorch stacks**
- No fuel deliveries fail
- No Guardian is ignited by **Soulfire Spirals**

Then at **33% HP**, Kapaar pauses mid-dash.

> He slams *Gospel* into the floor and lets it burn out.  
> He rips off his helmet, revealing half his face seared with old flame scars.

> **Kapaar (quietly):**  
> “Alright... *you’re tougher than fire.*”  
> “Then let’s finish this... no tricks. Just ash and will.”

- From this point forward, **Kapaar fights unarmed**:
  - Uses **ground-punch shockwaves** and flame-charged melee kicks.
  - The arena stops rotating zones but continues to **restrict space** with blast shutters.
  - This phase becomes a high-focus brawl requiring smart spacing, cooldown timing, and finishers.

> **Lore Note:**  
> _Kapaar never feared death—he feared apathy._  
> He wanted to see fire in others—not just survive it, but become it.

---


## Encounter III – Ghar’kaan: The Crystal-Eyed Watcher

**Arena:**  
A ritual tower suspended within a fractured Hive spire. Four crystal glyph pillars orbit a glowing soul prism. The space is warped—sound lingers too long, and shadows flicker unnaturally.

**Opening Visual:**  
Ghar’kaan floats above the arena on a sniper platform, face obscured beneath her helm. Her gemlike eye glows with violet light. She addresses the fireteam in a calm, emotionless voice:

> “I see you. Not as you are—but as you fear you’ll become.”

---

### Phase I – Tower Shift

- One Guardian is randomly **Charmed**, marked by a violet tether connected to Ghar’kaan’s sniper perch.
- While Charmed:
  - Movement becomes inverted or locked.
  - Class abilities misfire.
  - The Guardian begins walking toward glyph pillars to sabotage them.
  - Proximity triggers a disruptive pulse that destabilizes crystal control.

- Teammates must locate and use **Focus Beads**, dropped from **Crystalbind Acolytes**, to cleanse the affected Guardian.

> **Failsafe – Mercy Kill:**  
> If cleansing fails, a teammate may perform a Mercy Kill.  
> - This cancels the sabotage but empowers Ghar’kaan.
> - Affected glyph pillar becomes locked for the rest of the phase.
> - Multiple Mercy Kills apply **Guilt-Fused Memory**, accelerating soul prism instability.

---

### Phase II – Crystal Resonance

- The central soul prism displays **animated glyphs** that must be matched with their corresponding **crystal glyph pillars**.

> Before shooting, the correct **Sniper Relic** must be retrieved from a nearby ritual pedestal:
>
> - **Void Sniper Relic** – Circling/orbiting glyphs  
> - **Solar Sniper Relic** – Jagged/spiked glyphs  
> - **Arc Sniper Relic** – Wave/current glyphs

- Each relic provides **one empowered shot** before burning out.
- Guardians must fire their relic snipes in **perfect synchronization** with the glyph’s mirrored twin on the opposite side.
- Failed timing resets glyphs and summons **Mind Echoes**—illusory hostile copies of the team.

> **Missed Shot Wipe Mechanic – Prism Collapse:**  
> If a relic sniper shot **completely misses** its target:
> - All glyph pillars overload.  
> - The prism ruptures.  
> - Mind Echoes overrun the arena.
> - Tower collapses inward.

**Wipe Text:** *“The prism shattered your focus.”*

---

### Final Phase – Eye of Control

- Ghar’kaan descends. The sniper tower dissolves.
- She now cycles:
  - **Crystal Flash** – Blinds and disables HUD + class abilities.
  - **Charm Zones** – Creates gravity-locked zones that pull players in.
  - **Soulspotting** – Targets one Guardian with a delayed glyph snipe through a mirrored lens. Players must break LoS.

- Positioning and movement become critical. Team must rotate and communicate precisely under pressure.

---

### Wipe Mechanic

> *“Your will was not your own.”*  
Triggered if:
- A Charmed Guardian is killed more than once  
- Glyph matching fails three times  
- The soul prism overloads  
- A relic sniper shot is missed (see Prism Collapse)

---

### Challenge Mode – Through Her Eyes

> No Charmed Guardian may be killed during the entire encounter.

**Reward:** Sniper Boost + Lore Unlock – _Mindglass Precision_

---

### Redemption Detail – Voluntary Clarity

If the fireteam:
- Uses only **Focus Beads** to cleanse every Charmed Guardian
- Hits **all glyphs in perfect sync**
- Uses the correct **relic type** every time

Then during her descent, Ghar’kaan hesitates.

> “This… wasn’t what I wanted. But I needed to know if someone could break the pattern.”

- **Crystal Flash** is removed from her rotation.
- She instead uses:
  - **Void Pull** – A harmless gravitational tug.
  - **Prism Break** – A beam that splits on impact with reflective surfaces. Teammates must block or intercept the beams to protect the marked player.

> **Lore Note:**  
> _Ghar’kaan does not seek control. She seeks proof that someone can endure what broke her—and still remain themselves._

---


## Encounter IV – Harth’noak: The Mourning Bomb

**Arena:**  
A sorrow-drenched Hive tomb beneath the Chamber, cracked and unstable. Blue light pulses through the veins of the stone floor. At its center, the massive, rune-scarred figure of **Harth’noak** hovers in silence—his grief a bomb waiting to detonate.

---

### Phase I – Calming Protocol

- The fireteam must manage the **Pressure Threshold**, a grief meter that rises as Harth’noak absorbs ambient soul energy.
- If the meter reaches 100%, his emotional instability causes a **Grief Bomb** detonation (see Wipe Mechanic).
- Defeat **Fallen Echoes** and **Hallowed Acolytes** to collect **Remnants of Calm**.
- Deliver Remnants to specific ritual altars around the arena to lower the threshold.
- Too many missed deposits will cause sudden **spikes in pressure** and increase enemy spawns.

---

### Phase II – Cursed Thrall Control

- As the tomb destabilizes, **Cursed Thralls** begin to spawn in waves.
- Each detonation from a Thrall further accelerates the **Pressure Threshold**.
- Players must rotate between **calming rituals** and **Thrall suppression**, maintaining emotional and spatial control of the arena.

---

### Emote Failsafe – Show Him You’re Still There

If the **Pressure Threshold surpasses 75%** without calming progress, **Harth’noak begins to spiral**.

> *“He’s slipping… He can’t feel you.”*

- **All Guardians must perform an emote within 10 seconds.**
- The emote can be performed anywhere in the arena—any gesture works.

**If successful:**
- Harth’noak releases a soft rumble.
- The **Pressure freezes for 8 seconds**, buying precious recovery time.

**If failed:**
- **The Grief Bomb detonates immediately**.

> **Wipe Text:** *“You never reached him.”*

---

### Phase III – Defusal Runes

- Once the Pressure Threshold is stabilized, **rune fragments** scatter across the arena.
- Guardians must collect and return the fragments to the core without letting enemy pressure reset the ritual.
- Timed coordination is critical—too slow, and the **Threshold starts climbing again**.

---

### Final Phase – The Core Decision

- Once all runes are restored, **Harth’noak falls to his knees**, trembling, hands open.
- A single Guardian is prompted:

> *“Will you carry his burden?”*

That Guardian alone can:

**Option 1 – Shoot the Core:**
- Harth’noak does not resist.
- A violet light pulses. He detonates in a wave of soulfire.
- A whisper from **Ghar’kaan’s memory** echoes:
  > “He wasn’t ready… but you were.”

**Option 2 – Offer Peace:**
- If the Guardian holds a **Remnant of Ghar’kaan**, they may place it in his hands.
- Harth’noak clutches it.
- His core dims. His trembling stops.

> Ghar’kaan’s voice echoes softly:
> *“She gave me peace. He… never got that. Until now.”*

- The arena glows faintly, the grief dissipates, and the path forward opens without violence.

---

### Wipe Mechanic – The Grief Bomb

> *“He wasn’t angry. He was in pain.”*

Triggers if:
- The **Pressure Threshold** reaches 100%
- The **emote failsafe is ignored or failed**
- **Core rituals are disrupted** during defusal or decision

The arena collapses in a detonation of soul energy.

---

### Challenge Mode – No Sorrow Spilled

> Complete the encounter without killing Harth’noak.

**Reward:** Ghost Shell – _"Gravemind Core"_

---

### Redemption Detail – He Let Go

If:
- The Pressure Threshold never breaches critical
- No one shoots the core
- A Guardian successfully offers peace with the **Remnant of Ghar’kaan**

Then:
- Harth’noak closes his hands, kneels fully, and fades into silence.

> Ghar’kaan’s voice echoes:
> *“He remembers her… and he remembers you.”*

The tomb calms. No loot fanfare. Just release.

> **Lore Note:**  
> _He was never meant to be a weapon. He was a memory denied peace—until someone was brave enough to reach him with more than force._

---


## Final Encounter – Kezen: The Undermind of Regret

**Arena:**  
A fragmented Hive soulspace—drifting glyphs, spiraling void energy, and broken ritual fragments suspended in memory. The ritual collapses around her. Echoes of H.I.L.T. flicker like forgotten dreams. Kezen, veiled in braided cloth and bone, hovers in silence, controlling the arena like a conductor of sorrow.

---

### Phase I – Conjuring Disruption

- The arena displays **four rune symbols**, each chosen from three possible glyphs:
  - `/` – Sword Relic  
  - `X` – Bones Relic  
  - `B-7` – Bravo-7 Fragment Relic

> Example glyph layout: `/`, `/`, `X`, `B-7`

- The fireteam must:
  1. Identify all four runes and determine the **duplicated symbol**
  2. Retrieve relics that match any of the four active symbols
  3. **Deposit all four relics simultaneously** (order does not matter, but timing does)

---

#### Shadow Realm – Rune Mirror Phase

- **Two Guardians are pulled** into a Shadow Realm version of the arena.
- Inside are **three rune sites** and a **random Shadow of Regret**—a corrupted version of a H.I.L.T. member (Kiln, Kapaar, Ghar’kaan, or Harth’noak).

> The Shadow roams between runes **without attacking unless provoked**.

- The goal:
  - Wait for the Shadow to walk beneath the rune matching the **duplicated glyph from the real realm**
  - Then **engage and kill it before time runs out**

- If provoked too early, the Shadow becomes aggressive, strafe-dodges, and may escape if not killed in time.

---

#### Realm Crossover – Judgment Phase

- If the Shadow of Regret is slain at the correct rune:
  - It respawns in the real realm as a weakened enemy.
  - A **glyph floats above its head**, indicating which relic is required to kill it.
  - If struck by the correct relic, it falls. If not, it remains immune.

- If the wrong rune is used or time expires:
  - The Shadow escapes empowered, causing:
    - A **Soullash explosion**
    - 20-second **memory desync**, locking relic deposits

---

### Phase II – H.I.L.T. Shadows

- Kezen conjures corrupted **phantoms of H.I.L.T. members**, one at a time:
  - **Kiln** – Oath Pulse zones  
  - **Kapaar** – Flame spiral hazards  
  - **Ghar’kaan** – Charmed ally effect  
  - **Harth’noak** – Grief aura raises Pressure Threshold

- Shadows enrage if left active too long or handled by the same player.

---

### Phase III – Mask Break

- After all Shadows are defeated, a cutscene plays.
- Kezen’s mask fractures.

> *“If I don’t remember them… maybe I won’t feel it anymore.”*

- The floor collapses. You fall into her soulspace.

---

### Final Phase – The Undermind Unleashed

- Kezen now hovers in a void starfield of glyphs.
- She cycles between:

  - **Rift Collapse** – Parts of the arena disappear
  - **Memory Lock** – One Guardian sees Kezen’s past; others must help them escape
  - **Soul Pulses** – Massive grief blasts that must be **reflected using mirrored glyph shields**

> Reflections require perfect angle and timing. Failed pulses knock back or trigger wipe.

---

### Wipe Mechanic

> *“If I don’t remember them… maybe I won’t feel it anymore.”*

Triggers if:
- 3 Soul Pulses go unreflected  
- A Memory Lock isn’t broken  
- Rift Collapse consumes >75% of arena  
- Two Shadow Realm failures in one cycle

---

### Challenge Mode – Memory Unbroken

> Reflect every Soul Pulse and cleanse every Memory Lock within 10 seconds.

**Reward:** Exotic Boost + Emote – _Remembrance Ritual_

---

### Redemption Route – Let Her Remember

**At 33% HP**, if the fireteam:
- Reflects all Soul Pulses  
- Breaks all Memory Locks  
- Matches and syncs relics perfectly  
- A Guardian holds the **Remnant of Ghar’kaan** or **Harth’noak**

Then Kezen collapses, mask breaking fully.

> Prompt appears: _“Let her remember?”_

- If confirmed, the Remnant is consumed.
- A cinematic plays:
  - H.I.L.T. echoes appear behind her.
  - Ghar’kaan’s voice returns:
    > *“She carried us all. We carry her now.”*

- Kezen fades—no rage, no collapse. Just peace.

---

- Standard loot drops immediately upon cinematic ending.

# C.o.T Lore Entries (ordered)

## If Harth’noak is Spared:

**Bonus Lore Entry – “One More Thread...”**
(Harth’noak spared)
*Vanessa Winterfield’s final offering, post-Chamber.*

> I made another one.

Eight legs. Not polished. Not perfect.
But real.

I left it on the ledge in the Chamber where Kezen’s mask broke.
Ghar’kaan was standing there. She didn’t speak. She just watched it.

I walked up. Said nothing.
Just reached into my satchel, pulled out the thread-bound charm, and offered it.

Her hand didn’t shake.

I said, “You don’t have to wear it. Just… hold onto it.”

She looked at it for a long time.
Then said, “You named it?”

I nodded.
“One more thread.”

I don’t know what she did with it after.
But she didn’t throw it away.

---

**Ghar’kaan Lore Entry – “...Held, & Kept”**
(Harth’noak spared)
*One line recovered. The rest, reconstructed from residual Hive soul-lattice.*

> “It wasn’t mine.

But it didn’t have to be.”

I remember standing in the wake of the Chamber. The glyphs still pulsing like blood that refuses to forget.

Vanessa approached. No weapon. No aura of ritual or showmanship. Just her—frazzled, luminous, soft-spoken.

She offered it to me. Eight legs. Threaded meaning.

I knew what it was. A charm. A sign. A connection.
I had seen it before. But not held it.

Hive memory is built on offerings. Sacrifice. Tribute.
This… wasn’t that.

It was grief.
Tangible. Transferable.
Not to burden, but to share.

I didn’t refuse. I didn’t accept.
I just held it.

And when I walked away, I realized something unexpected:

I was still holding it."

---
**Ghar’kaan Lore Entry – “Echoes That Stay”**
(Harth’noak spared)
*Unlocked if Harth’noak is spared and raid is completed with No Sorrow Spilled.*

> The chamber didn’t fall silent.
   It… settled.

I could still feel the ritual threads humming, still see the glyphs pulsing in the walls.
But for once, they weren’t warnings.
They were… alive.

I found him at the center.
Not kneeling. Not chained.
Standing.

The runes on his skin still burned—but they weren’t thrashing.
He looked at me. No mask. Just grief. And recognition.

I stepped forward. He didn’t flinch.

“Do you remember me?” I asked.
He nodded. Once.

No Hive chant. No light surge. No whispers from Kezen’s buried mind.

Just us. Two remnants left behind.

I stood beside him for as long as he let me.
When he turned away, I didn’t stop him.
I didn’t need to.

Some echoes don’t fade.
Some choose to stay.


---

## If Harth’noak is slain

**Vanessa Lore Entry – “Held Anyway”**
(Harth’noak slain)
*Recorded post-raid. Logged by Cross.*

> She didn’t say a word when I gave it to her.

Just… stared at it.

I thought she’d turn away. Thought she might even walk right through me like I didn’t matter—like Harth didn’t matter.

But she didn’t.

She took it.

Didn’t tie it around her neck. Didn’t tuck it away.
Just held it in her open palm.

And I watched something shift in her shoulders—like her posture loosened just a little.

Like that necklace wasn’t mine anymore.
And maybe, for a moment, neither was the grief.

“You don’t have to keep it,” I said.
“It’s okay.”

She looked at me then. Eyes like glass lit from within.

“I won’t,” she whispered. “But I’ll hold it.”

And that was the most honest answer I’ve ever heard.

---

Ghar’kaan Lore Entry – “The Last Silence”
(Harth’noak slain)
*Unlocked if Harth’noak is slain during the encounter.*

> They asked if I had anything to say.

I didn’t.

Silence is not absence.
It is the weight of what could’ve been said… but wasn’t.

Harth didn’t scream when he fell. He didn’t beg. He didn’t roar.

He looked at me. And that was enough.

We were all made into weapons once. Me through purpose. Him through pain.
But somewhere in him was a thread—frail, knotted, tangled in grief—that still pulsed with will.

I saw it.
And so did she.

But they severed it.

The thread, the pulse, the moment.

I won’t blame them.
But I will remember.

And if silence has a sound…
That chamber still echoes it.

---
# C.o.T Post Raid Lore

**Vanessa’s Log – “That Place Changed Me”**
(After whichever choice made on Harth’noak)
*Scrawled on faded purple paper, later digitized by Cross.*

> I don’t usually write in full sentences.
   My logs are fragments. Glimpses.

But something about Harth… Kezen… the way the soulspace held us—it stuck.

There was a moment—just a moment—where I saw my own grief on his face.
Not his. Mine.

And for a heartbeat, I didn’t want to fight. I just wanted to sit next to him.

That’s not weakness.
That’s… something else.

I don’t know if the others felt it, too. Zakk went quiet. Harlo didn’t patch the team comms for a few minutes.

Vega whistled. That usually means he’s hurting and hiding it.

All I know is… something broke open in there.

And maybe it was supposed to.

## H.I.L.T Terminal Echoes (hidden lore in C.o.T)

*crafted to reflect each of their core traits, voice, and fate. These entries are posthumous echoes, recovered by Ghosts or accessed in hidden lore terminals within the Chamber of Trials or nearby zones.*

**Kezen – Echo Terminal: “Ashes Remember”**

**Location**: Chamber of Trials – Ritual Spire

**Recovered By**: Ghost “Vriss” (linked to Zakk Romletté)

**Status**: Fragmented, emotionally volatile


---

> [AUDIO START – QUIET SOULFIRE STATIC]



Soft wind. Something cracks—perhaps a charm or mask. Kezen speaks in near-whisper.

Kezen (recording):
“I have never asked for forgiveness.
Only to be remembered differently.”

A pause. She exhales a chant under her breath, syllables half-broken.

“I built this chamber from bones and regrets. I stitched it with threads no one saw. Not even them.

Maybe… maybe that was the failure.
They followed me.
Because I gave them something to hold.

But I never told them how heavy it would be.”

The sound of her stitching something—ritual thread passes through worn cloth.

“I thought I could quiet the echoes.

Instead… I became one.”

**Kapaar – Echo Terminal: “Residual Heat”**

**Location**: Chamber of Trials – Furnace Depths

**Recovered By**: Ghost “Cross” (linked to Yerk Vega)

**Log Type**: Hidden Lore Terminal / Personal Log Archive

**Status**: Degraded, partially reconstructed


---

> [AUDIO START – STATIC AND METAL CREAKING]



A slow hiss of pressurized soulfire. Machinery hums low in the background. There’s an exhale—tired, unfiltered.

Kapaar (recording log):
“So… if you’re hearing this? Either you’re cooked like the rest, or you figured out how to stay cool long enough to poke around my mess. Good on you. Seriously.

Either way, I ain’t around anymore.”

Clinks something metal. Could be Gospel—could be armor.

“Kiln always said I burned too loud. Said I fought like I was trying to make the galaxy blink.

He was right, probably.

But this? This whole setup?
I built it knowing it would fail.
Not because I wanted it to—because I trusted someone else to make it through.
You.”

Pauses. The tone dips softer.

“I laid out vent paths in unstable arcs—yes, on purpose. I knew the pressure zones would loop if I overloaded the fuel cores.
Kezen would’ve lectured me. Kiln would’ve sighed.

But I’m telling you now:
This place isn’t just a furnace.
It’s a memory trap.
It burns what you bring into it.
So I brought everything.

My bad ideas. My rage. My best jokes. My worst ones.
All of it’s in the walls now.”

Another pause. A light clack—he’s adjusting his gear.

“If you found Gospel...
Don’t point her like I did.
She isn’t just a flamethrower. She’s a warning.

Kiln said I’d blow myself up one day.
I told him good.
Let it be loud enough to wake gods.”

Long silence. His voice gets distant—quieter, almost hesitant.

“Tell Kiln I owe him a drink.
A real one this time. Not coolant mixed with fungus tonic.

Tell Harth I’m sorry for the time I used him as cover. And also for calling him ‘Thermal Detonator Dad.’ That was… okay, maybe a little funny.

Tell Ghar’kaan...
Forget it.
She already knows.
Probably rolled her eyes just now.”

Chuckles—genuinely, this time. Then: nothing for a beat.

“You don’t have to remember me.
Just… don’t put the safety back on.

Some of us were born to burn.”

**Kiln Auga’thuun – Echo Terminal: “If the Line Breaks”**

**Location**: Collapsed Runewall beneath Chamber I

**Recovered By**: Ghost “Pipp” (linked to Vanessa Winterfield)

**Status**: Etched Log / Seismic Audio Reflection


---

> [AUDIO START – DEEP RESONANT HUM]



Low rumble. Seismic tension. Kiln’s voice is calm, anchored.

Kiln (recording):
“There will be a moment…
when the wall groans.”

He breathes through his helm.

“And you’ll wonder if it’s strong enough.
If you’re strong enough.

That’s the moment I’m talking to.

Don’t brace with fear.
Brace with purpose.

Because the line doesn’t hold by accident.
It holds when someone decides it must.”

There’s a faint clink of metal—perhaps his cleaver locking into his axe.

“If this place falls…
let it fall knowing I never moved.”

**Ghar’kaan – Echo Terminal: “Thread Kept”**

**Location**: Crystal Watch Chamber – Tower Three

**Recovered By:** Ghost “Zin” (linked to Kaniss Romletté)

**Status**: Encrypted Mind-Log / Emotional Lattice Mode


---

> [AUDIO START – PSYCHIC STATIC, CRYSTAL TONES]



A breath. Not sharp—controlled. Ghar’kaan’s voice is steady, colder than most.

Ghar’kaan (recording):
“I was made for silence.

To move through it. To use it.

But not even silence is empty.”

Brief pause.

“I watched the chamber fracture. I watched Harth scream without sound.
I watched Kezen fall in her own soulspace.

And still… I didn’t look away.”

A faint crystal pulse hums, like a heartbeat.

“They thought I wouldn’t keep the thread.

But I did.
I always do.”

**Harth’noak – Echo Terminal: “Handprint”**

**Location**: Hidden beneath Mourning Vault – if spared

**Recovered By**: Ghost “Quasie” (linked to Dannie Garcia)

**Status**: Non-verbal / Visual-Echo Log


---

> [VISUAL-ONLY RECORD – NO AUDIO]



A single Thrall clawprint on a shattered platform.

Harth stands still—not aggressive, not trembling. Pale blue glow flickers within his chest.

He looks toward the exit, where Ghar’kaan once stood.

Then, slowly, he kneels.

And places his massive hand over the clawprint.

For once, he chooses silence.
Not because he is broken—because he remembers.
