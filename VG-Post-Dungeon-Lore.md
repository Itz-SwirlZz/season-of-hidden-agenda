## Pistillum’s Post-Dungeon Lore – “Bloom After Burn”

*Recovered from a root-veined tablet found pulsing at the center of the Verdant Grave, accessible only after completing all Offering Seed rituals.*

> “I saw what you did.
Not just the violence.
The offerings. The choices. The hesitations.



Some of you wept before striking.
Some struck with joy.
One of you apologized to a flower.

The garden forgave that one.

I am not unchanged.
I watched the soil shift where your blood met mine.
I watched the vines pulse with names.
I wrote none of this. But I remember every letter.

The field grows again.
Not because you earned it—
But because it’s time.”

— Pistillum

> “Translation complete. Meaning unclear. Very Pistillum.
Also, one of the petals whispered your name when we archived this.
You may want to get that checked.”

 ## Hidden Terminal Log – "Cross-Pollination"

Classified log. Timestamp untraceable. Format inconsistent.

> >> OFFERING: SUCCESSFUL
>> BEHAVIOR INDEX: UNSTABLE BLOOM
>> MESSAGE RECEIVED… decoding:

"Some of you gave without expectation.
Some of you took without shame.
The garden knew. I knew.
Roots are not blind.
They grow around what they cannot change.
But they also push back."

"You weren’t supposed to survive.
And yet—here you are.
That makes you part of the field now.
Sleep near it again and it might call your name."

>> WARNING: Biomass detected inside fireteam cloak. Immediate wash recommended.

 ## Cinematic Transcript – "After the Roots Whisper"

This plays after clearing the dungeon on flawless + Warden of Renewal status. Player cannot move. Music softens. Pistillum’s voice echoes:

> “You completed the rituals.
You walked carefully. You listened.
That’s rare.



Your Light is loud…
but your silence? That was enough.

The field has heard many screams.
You gave it… a breath.
And in return—”
(soft floral wind rushes past)
“—it blooms again. You may walk among it.”

(A flower blooms from the player’s hand. Pistillum does not appear. The screen fades to black.)

 ## Lore Tab – "Petal Signature" (Unlocked after 10 successful rituals)

Accessed from inside the Verdant Grave’s final chest. Written in flowering glyphs that autotranslate:

> “The Garden does not reward perfection.
It rewards presence.
To stand in bloom and not destroy it… that is rare.
To destroy it and regret—that is honest.
Either way, you’ve become soil.
And from soil, something else will rise.”



—Pistillum

> Stamped underneath: a signature in pollen. It sparkles briefly. Then dissolves.
