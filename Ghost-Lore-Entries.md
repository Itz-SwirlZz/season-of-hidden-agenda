# Cross (Ghost of Yerk Vega)

> Unsent response log. Stored in Cross’s backup cache.

“For a man obsessed with odds, Vega rarely gives himself the benefit of the doubt.

I monitor pulse shifts. I watch him lie with his smile. I tally how many times he rerolls the same die just to feel like he’s in control. Statistically? He knows his team better than he knows himself.

And yet he keeps quiet. Like trusting us would collapse the whole algorithm.

I wish he’d understand: it’s okay to be the variable sometimes.

Even in a perfect run, something unexpected makes the win feel real.”

# Gidjitt (Ghost of Harlo-9)

> Diagnostic Memo – Internal journal override

“Harlo doesn’t say much. He doesn’t need to. But that doesn’t mean he’s not thinking.

Every time he repairs something, I log it. Not the work—the intent. Because his hands aren’t fixing machines. They’re fixing the team.

He built me with pieces no one else cared to recover. I was considered scrap. He gave me a second run.

So now I stick close. Too close, probably. I cheer when he frowns. I chirp when he sighs.

I’m not just his Ghost. I’m his reminder that he is more than silence.”

# Pipp (Ghost of Vanessa Winterfield)

> Side Log: Pipp’s Personal Addendum

“Vanessa’s logs are always beautiful disasters. Full of scratched-out thoughts, rewritten feelings, and doodles of threadlings with names like ‘Squishy’ and ‘Captain Wiggle.’

She writes like she’s trying to feel everything at once.

I keep her focused when she spins too fast. I store the entries she forgets she’s even written.

When she doubts herself, I flicker her own words back to her. I remind her that wonder is not weakness.

And yes—I’ve named her journal pens. I’m not ashamed.”

# Zinnatrix “Zin” (Ghost of Kaniss Romletté)

> Arc Loop Whisper

“Precision is a prayer, and Kaniss is a believer.

She doesn’t ask for permission. She shapes light like silk webbing—calculated, elegant, absolute.

I don’t guide her hand. I follow it.

She says I think in poetry. Maybe I do. But when she lays the trap, and it snaps with perfect timing...

I write sonnets in electrical bursts.

My tethers are hers. My silence is focus. We don’t need words when voltage sings.”

# Vriss (Ghost of Zakk Romletté)

> Confidential Echo - Not for public logs

“I know people think he’s dramatic. Arrogant. Obsessed with something darker than Void.

Good. Let them think that.

I’m the only one who sees what’s underneath. That wild devotion? It’s not powerlust—it’s desperation.

He wants to understand Nötivart because he’s afraid he’ll become him.

I never tell him that. I just cover his back when he starts chanting again.

I’m not here to talk him out of the ritual. I’m here to make sure he walks out of it alive.”

# Quasie (Ghost of Dannie Garcia)

> Sparrow Sync Transmission

“I don’t talk much. Dannie talks enough for both of us.

She’s chaos in motion. I’m the quiet math under the wheels.

I’ve overridden four detonation sequences she forgot she primed. I’ve remotely rerouted a Sparrow mid-air because she thought she could ‘slide through that gap.’

She’s a streak of wildfire and half-sent apologies.

And I would follow her through any explosion. Even the ones she didn’t mean to cause.”
