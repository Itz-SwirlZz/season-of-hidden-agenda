## **Echoes Unraveled**  
_Alternate outcomes, hidden triggers, and untold consequences from across the Zafe Sone canon._

**Note:** Echoes Unraveled is for **canon-divergent what-if scenarios**—branching timelines, failsafe activations, and moral missteps that could have canonically happened *if players or characters made different choices.* These entries are serious, often tragic, and always consequential.

### **BRAVO-7**

<details>
<summary>**Vanessa Winterfield**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "The Necklace Left Behind"*  
In a divergent path where Vanessa fails to protect Suzie during a secondary incursion, the eight-legged necklace is left behind—lost in the rubble. Days later, it reappears in the hands of a Threadling she didn’t summon. She never speaks of it again.

<details>
<summary>**Yerk Vega**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "The Gambler’s Grief"*  
If Vega pushes too far during a covert mission and sacrifices his Ghost for the objective, it permanently disables his subclass connection. He still rolls dice, but only to feel something.

# Vega’s Echo – Unraveled

**Classification:** Personal Memory Log [Encrypted: V.R. Access Only]  
**Subject:** V.N.W. Incident // Final Engagement

---

## “The Bloom That Chose to Wilt”  

The scrolls hit the floor.  
The silence before them felt like reverence.

Then the world dropped with them.

Threadlings *burst outward,* clawing through the soil like memory made teeth—  
one caught Vega’s ankle mid-stride.

He shot it point-blank. Ash.

> “You’re better than this, ‘Nessa…”

Vanessa’s voice came from everywhere.  
Five overlapping tones—each one hers, none of them home:

> “I’m *free* now.”

---

### Combat Sequence: Memory vs. Mercy

Vega slid. Pulse rifle up.  
Vanessa was already mid-air, flipping—threadlings *whipping* her like puppeteer strings.

**Fire. Spin. Deflect.**  
Her shield of thread caught the burst and bent it into smoke.

They clashed.

**Hand to hand.**  
Flesh and thread.  
Love turned to reflex.

- Vega blocked a rising knee.  
- Vanessa caught his forearm and wrapped it in burning thread.  
- He slammed her shoulder and disengaged—rolled clean.

> “You’re not fighting to win,” Vega gasped.  
> “You’re fighting to be *remembered.*”

Vanessa grinned.  
Her eyes still **bright blue.** But the flicker had begun.

> “Then remember *this.*”

She lunged.  
He countered.  
Grapple. Elbow. Slam. Break.

Her movement was feral—like grief made ferocious.

He dropped the rifle.  
Switched stance.  
**Elbow. Knee. Palm. Flow.**

Every hit struck.  
Every strike echoed *who they used to be.*

---

### Emotional Shift: The Fracture Point

She took the blows.  
Not because they didn’t hurt—  
but because they *meant something.*

> “You taught me rhythm,” she whispered.  
> “But I learned how to break it.”

She kicked the rifle toward him.  
When he reached—  
a threadling burst from the barrel.

He flinched.  
She vanished.  
Then—**was behind him.**

Fist cocked.

**He didn’t dodge.**

The punch landed.  
He didn’t fall.  
He just looked at her—with tears behind his visor.

> “I never saw you as broken,” he said.  
> “I just wanted to carry you out of whatever you were drowning in.”

Her eyes burned **red.**  
Then cracked.  
**Violet.**

Then **blue.**

She trembled.

> “You were never supposed to cry,” she whispered.

> “Neither were you.”

---

### The End

The threadlings fell limp.  
Her hands opened.  
Her knees buckled.

Vega approached.

She didn’t resist.

He took her scroll in one hand.  
Her trembling fingers in the other.

> “Do it,” she said. “Before I become worse.”

He looked into her eyes one last time.  
**Blue.**

Still hers.

He placed a shot through the scroll’s core.

It cracked.

No Light.

Just collapse.

---

> *She died in his arms.  
>  
> And her eyes—blue to the end—shattered him more than her silence ever could.*

<details>
<summary>**Pistillum**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "Petal Duel Fallout"*  
If the Bouquet Leader had finished what they started, the resulting flora burst would have torn Gliese’s seasonal balance apart. Glenndale would be caught in eternal bloom—and decay.

<summary>**The Bouquet Leader**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "Eightfold Consequence"*  
Had they spoken Ghar’kaan’s name during their last incursion, the crown would’ve bloomed a ninth flower—one Ghar’kaan wasn’t ready to remember. Her entire soulstate would've destabilized.

### **H.I.L.T.**

<details>
<summary>**Kiln Auga’thuun**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "The Broken Wall Protocol"*  
If Harth’noak is killed, Kiln removes his helmet. His silence breaks, and his control fails. What follows is not rage—it’s inevitability. He activates the Broken Wall Protocol, and the Chamber of Scars is born.

### *Echo Sequence – Kiln & Kapaar: The Crack, The Silence, The Fire*  
**Characters:** Kiln Auga’thuun & Kapaar  
**Placement:** Echoes Unraveled (Kiln’s Section)

---

#### *Part I: "Words That Crack Stone"*

The chamber was quiet. The kind of quiet Kiln preferred—clean, echoing, absolute.  

Kapaar, still fuming from a failed run, paced hard enough to spark embers.  
> “You wanna talk about *control* again?” he snapped. “Is that your whole thing now? ‘Cause I don’t see how it helped when—when Ghar’kaan almost bled out watching Harth boil over, or when Kezen needed—”

Kiln didn’t move.

> “—or when I was burning alive under rubble and *you just stood there!*”

That one landed.

Kiln’s posture didn’t shift, but something changed.  
He didn’t reply with a quote or a deflection.  
Instead—**he reached up.**

Slowly, deliberately—**his gauntlets touched his helmet.**

Kapaar froze mid-step, mid-curse.  
> “Wait, wait—Kiln, don’t—”  

The air thickened. Even the firelight dimmed.  
Kapaar took two steps back. His voice cracked.

> “I-I didn’t mean that. I just—I was angry, I didn’t—I didn’t mean it.”  

Kiln never removed the helmet. But his fingers stayed there.  
Pressed against it like something inside was vibrating. Unstable.

He spoke low.  
> “You mean everything you say, Kapaar. That’s why you’re fire.”

Then he turned. Walked out. Slowly. Controlled.

Kapaar stood alone, hands shaking. The flamethrower on his back hissed like it couldn’t decide whether to cool or ignite.

> “I didn’t mean that…” he whispered again. “I didn’t…”

---

#### *Part II: "Cracks That Don’t Heal, But Hold"*

He sat alone.

Not meditating. Not guarding. Just… still.

His fingers had never made it past the helm seal. He didn’t know if he’d *almost* removed it, or if he’d just wanted Kapaar to think he had. Either way, the silence that followed was louder than any shout Kapaar had ever thrown.

Later that night, someone left a note at his door.  
Charcoal. Smudged. Folded five times. No signature.

> *“I said something that shouldn’t have been said.  
> You knew it. I knew it. I felt it before I finished the word.  
> But you stood there and didn’t break.  
> I wanted you to.  
> And now I hate myself for it.  
>  
> I don’t have control. But I’m trying.  
> Because you gave me a reason to try.”*

There was a fingerprint burned into the bottom right corner.  
Kiln stared at it for a while.

Then, finally, he folded the paper again—carefully this time—and placed it into the groove behind his shield’s inner lining.

A place no one ever looked.

> *“Some fires don’t burn structures,”* he whispered, helmeted voice almost inaudible.  
> *“They temper them.”*

He didn’t tell Kapaar he forgave him. He didn’t need to.

The next time they fought side by side, they didn’t speak.  
But when Kapaar nearly fell—and the flames turned wild—Kiln was already there.

Hand on shoulder. Axe drawn.  
Control, just within insanity.

---

#### *Part III: "Without the Flame, There’s Still Smoke"*

The chamber was empty. Not a mission. No fire. No crowd.

Just Kiln, seated on a stone bench, running a whetstone across his axe—slow, steady.

Kapaar stood at the entrance.

No words yet.  
For once, he didn’t storm in. Didn’t explode with apologies or quips.

He walked forward and stopped exactly six paces away.

Kiln didn’t look up.  
Didn’t stop sharpening.  
Didn’t move.

That was fine.

Kapaar exhaled slowly. His voice shook, but not from anger.

> “When I yell, I’m still listening.  
> When I burn, I still care.  
> But when I said *that*, I wasn’t doing either.  
>  
> I didn’t mean to hurt you.  
> But I did.”

Still no response.

So Kapaar did the only thing that *meant* something.  
The one thing **Kiln always understood.**

He reached up, unclipped his own helmet, and removed it.  
Slowly. Gently.  
Then held it at his side—exposed, vulnerable.

Not to challenge.  
Not to beg.  
Just… to *mean it.*

Kiln stopped sharpening.

Still didn’t look up. But his hand gripped the axe a little tighter—then eased.  
Not with tension.  
With understanding.

Kapaar stepped forward.  
Set the helmet down between them on the bench.  
Then sat beside it—quiet, almost reverent.

> “I don’t know how you do it,” he said finally. “But I’ll learn.  
>  
> I just… I hope you’ll still be around if I do.”

Kiln didn’t reply.

But when they left that chamber later, **Kapaar’s helmet stayed behind.**  
And no one—not Kezen, not Harlo, not even Vanessa—ever saw him wear it again unless it was for battle.

Because respect doesn’t need armor.  
Only intention.

<summary>**Kapaar**</summary>

# Echo Entry – "Incineration Point: Let Me Be Loud"
*If Kapaar wasn’t soothed—if no hand steadied him, no voice met him where he boiled—then fire would stop asking for space and start taking it. This is not vengeance. It’s permission denied.*

## Echo Sequence – Kiln, Harlo & Kezen: “When the Burn Spoke Back”
**Placement:** Kapaar’s Echoes  
**Characters:** Kapaar, Kiln Auga’thuun, Harlo-9, Kezen (off-screen voice)

---

### Part I: “That’s Not My Voice Anymore”

The mission was simple.  
Routine sweep. Overgrown ridge. One signal missing.

But when Harlo and Kiln returned, **Kapaar was already screaming.**

Not words. Not yet.  
Just *volume*.  
Not rage. Not chaos. Just—**pressure finally unlatched.**

His helmet was still on. Gospel was in both hands. The air stank of melted resin and cauterized bark.

> “DON’T TELL ME TO STAND DOWN!”

Harlo stepped forward.  
Kapaar spun. Gospel primed.

> “You *left me out there,* Harlo. You knew I was cracking.”

> “We didn’t know—”

> “NO! You *didn’t want to.* You saw the heat and closed the door!”

The blast behind him wasn’t aimed—but it still **ignited the canopy.**

Kiln stood perfectly still, axe slung. Not moving yet. But not walking away either.

> **“Your flame is too loud to guide if you blind yourself in it,”** Kiln offered.

Kapaar barked a dry laugh.

> “Says the Knight who speaks in puzzles and leaves *burnouts* like me behind while he does his *thinking.*”

> “I wasn’t trying to silence you.”

> “YOU DON’T HAVE TO. EVERYONE ELSE DID IT FOR YOU.”

---

### Part II: “Echo of the Charred Room”

Kezen’s voice broke in over the comms. Calm. Distant. Strategic.

> **“Kapaar. Withdraw from your current position. You’re not stable.”**

> “I KNOW.”

He ripped his helmet off.  
Not like a ritual.  
Like a ***shackle.***

Ash spilled down his chestplate. Gospel’s fuel line twisted like it was *breathing.*

> “You always wanted Kiln to control us.  
To *refine* us.  
Well guess what…”

He slammed Gospel into the ground. It hissed.

> “I’m not a candle.  
I’m the forest fire you all forgot to warn the next squad about.”

Harlo stepped in front of Kiln.

> “Please… I *hear* you. Just—”

> “No you don’t.”

Kapaar raised Gospel again.  
Not to fire.  
To **hold it like a spine.**

> “You *never did.*”

---

### Part III: “It Didn’t Matter That They Survived”

The burst happened without a shot.  
No one remembers the trigger.

Only the heat.

Kezen’s wards held. Just barely.  
But the ridge was leveled.  
The trees? Gone.  
The outpost equipment? Melted into something *that would never hold memory again.*

Kapaar stood at the center.  
Helmet cracked. Gospel half empty. Shoulders steaming.

Kiln approached.  
Didn’t raise a weapon.

> **“Is this you?”**

Kapaar didn’t answer.

> **“Or is this the silence we built around you finally speaking?”**

Kapaar holstered Gospel.

> “Does it matter?” he muttered.  
> “You’ll all remember the heat, not the scream that came first.”

He walked away.  
Didn’t look back.  
Didn’t *need* to.

---

> *They said he went rogue.*  
> *He didn’t.*  
> *He just stopped asking for room to burn.*

<summary>**Ghar’kaan**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "Disobedience: Full Break Path"*  
If Ghar’kaan is forced to choose between Harth’noak and Kezen, and she chooses the former, her sniper becomes more than a tool—it becomes a statement. One shot. One fracture. H.I.L.T. splinters.

## Echo Sequence – Kiln & Ghar’kaan: “The Stillness That Watched”
**Placement:** Ghar’kaan’s Echoes  
**Characters:** Ghar’kaan & Kiln Auga’thuun

---

### Part I: “Specter of the Mask”

The mask still sat where they’d left it.  
Untouched. Undisturbed. Just watching.

Kiln arrived first. His presence was a monument—still, grounded.

When Ghar’kaan entered, she didn’t announce herself. She walked until she stood before the mask and knelt—not reverent, just... tethered.

> “She used to say I had too much blade in my voice,” she said aloud.

Kiln, behind her, replied softly:  
> **“But blades can be honed. Poison only spreads.”**

She flinched—not from the words, but from the fact that he chose to speak.

> “She had poison?” Ghar’kaan asked.

> **“She had conviction,” Kiln answered. “But it outpaced her healing.”**

Silence.

Ghar’kaan finally muttered,  
> “I listened anyway.”

Kiln raised his left gauntlet to his right temple.  
*“I forgive.”*

Ghar’kaan tensed again.

> “…That’s not yours to give.”

> **“It isn’t,” Kiln replied. “But I carried it anyway.”**

---

### Part II: “The Mask Without Eyes”

They stayed there—her sitting, him standing, the mask between them like a shared ghost.

Ghar’kaan’s hand hovered over the mask but didn’t touch it.

> “She’s not in there,” she whispered. “But I still see her.”

Kiln stepped forward. Aligned his visor with the mask.

*The Mirror Bow.*

> **“She lives in what you didn’t say,”** he told her.  
> **“And what you regret.”**

> “Then she’s still angry.”

> **“No,” Kiln said. “She just never saw how much of her was in you.”**

Ghar’kaan’s breath hitched.

> “She gave me a second chance. I don’t know if I earned it.”

> **“She didn’t give it because you earned it,” Kiln replied.  
“She gave it because she *believed* you could.”**

---

### Part III: “She Left Her Eyes in Us”

They sat in the quiet together.

When Ghar’kaan finally stood, Kiln turned to leave.

At the chamber’s edge, he paused.

> **“I can carry weight,”** he said over his shoulder.  
> **“But not alone. Not forever.”**

Then he placed his right hand to his left temple.  
*“I remember.”*

This time, Ghar’kaan mirrored the gesture.  
And her fingers didn’t shake.

<summary>**Kezen**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "Unspoken Contingency"*  
She knew Kiln might fracture. She wrote the seal, forged the plan. But if she had revealed it to him, would he have resisted the fall? Or would knowing he had a failsafe have broken him faster?

## Echo Entry – “The Key With a Beating Heart”
**Placement:** Kezen’s Echoes  
**Focus:** What-if Contingency | Harth’noak & Kiln Auga’thuun

---

I made a seal for Kapaar—to stop the fire from consuming others.  
I made a seal for Ghar’kaan—to slow the mind from turning against itself.  
I made one for myself—to ensure no Guardian would ever worship my grief.

But not Kiln.  
Never Kiln.

His strength wasn’t physical. It was moral. Internal.  
And if I’d given him a seal, it would’ve meant I doubted it.  
So I gave him nothing.

Instead… I gave the world **Harth’noak**.

A quiet failsafe.  
Not to fight Kiln—*not directly.*  
But to **detonate** with enough grief and force to stop him cold, if the Knight ever fell beyond recall.  
Not kill. **Halt.**

But grief spreads like blood.  
So I bound the explosion in a seal—designed only to break if I released it.

> *“If Kiln fractures,” I wrote,  
> “let sorrow strike first—but let it strike only him.”*

If **Harth dies**, and the seal was *never lifted*…  
That means someone else did it.  
That means they *threw away the key.*

That means we chose to face Kiln’s full descent without preparation.

And that is a future I cannot save them from.

---

*They’ll never know how much I trusted Kiln.*  
*Not until they break the one thing I built to stop him.*

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Harth’noak**</summary>

# Echo Entry – “Name Without Meaning”
*He was called Harth’noak. But he never chose that name. In the silence between orders, he wondered if he was ever meant to choose anything at all.*

## Echo Sequence – Harth’noak & Ghar’kaan: “The Word Behind the Growl”  
**Placement:** Harth’noak’s Echoes  
**Characters:** Harth’noak, Ghar’kaan  
**Location:** A cracked temple deep within Gliese’s Pale Rift  

---

### Part I: “The Unspoken Cage”

The temple’s bones had long since caved in.  
Harth’noak sat in the rubble, fingers dragging ancient ash into spirals—slow and repetitive.

Ghar’kaan approached cautiously, sniper slung but not loaded.

> “You always come here,” she said.  
> “Even when we’re not posted nearby.”

Harth tilted his head—light flickering in his hollow eyes.

She knelt beside him, watching the ash patterns.

> “What are you drawing?”

No answer.

So she tried a different question.

> “Do you know what your name means?”

He stilled.

> “Kezen never explained it to me,” she admitted.  
> “But I looked up what I could.”

She whispered the Hive root-phrases.  
His glow flared, then dimmed.

> “*‘Servant of Harmonic Collapse.’*”

Harth brushed away the ash spiral. Slowly. Like it stung.

---

### Part II: “The Rumble That Refused”

They walked together along the broken sanctuary path.

Ghar’kaan didn’t speak. Neither did Harth.

But his body trembled—not from instability… from **tension** he could never verbalize.

She finally stopped.

> “You were made into this. But that doesn’t mean it’s all you are.”

Harth didn’t turn.  
But his hand rose to his chest—his glowing palm hovering where a heart might’ve once been.

He began to scratch.

Not a gesture. Not a sign. A word.

Crude. Ugly. Misspelled.

But a word.

> “NOAK”

Ghar’kaan blinked.

> “…Your name?”

He nodded once.

Then scratched again—this time on the crumbling stone wall.

One more word.

> “MINE.”

---

### Part III: “The Name He Buried”

They returned to the camp. No one noticed the new scarring on his armor.

Except Kezen.

She paused. Walked beside him. Looked at the marks.

She didn’t speak.

But she raised her hand—not to erase, not to command.

Just to place it gently on his shoulder.

> “If you ever want to change it,” she said,  
> “You won’t lose us.”

Harth stood still. Runes flickering in quiet contemplation.

But later that night, he returned to the temple alone.

And beneath the ash spiral, he scratched three words into the altar stone.

> “NOAK  
> WAS  
> HERE.”

And for the first time in his long, cursed life—  
He smiled.
