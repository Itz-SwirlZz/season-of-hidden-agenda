## **Echoes Unraveled**  
_Alternate outcomes, hidden triggers, and untold consequences from across the Zafe Sone canon._

**Note:** Echoes Unraveled is for **canon-divergent what-if scenarios**—branching timelines, failsafe activations, and moral missteps that could have canonically happened *if players or characters made different choices.* These entries are serious, often tragic, and always consequential.

### **BRAVO-7**

<details>
<summary>**Vanessa Winterfield**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "The Necklace Left Behind"*  
In a divergent path where Vanessa fails to protect Suzie during a secondary incursion, the eight-legged necklace is left behind—lost in the rubble. Days later, it reappears in the hands of a Threadling she didn’t summon. She never speaks of it again.

<details>
<summary>**Yerk Vega**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "The Gambler’s Grief"*  
If Vega pushes too far during a covert mission and sacrifices his Ghost for the objective, it permanently disables his subclass connection. He still rolls dice, but only to feel something.

### **NEUTRAL CHARACTERS**

<details>
<summary>**Pistillum**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "Petal Duel Fallout"*  
If the Bouquet Leader had finished what they started, the resulting flora burst would have torn Gliese’s seasonal balance apart. Glenndale would be caught in eternal bloom—and decay.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**The Bouquet Leader**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "Eightfold Consequence"*  
Had they spoken Ghar’kaan’s name during their last incursion, the crown would’ve bloomed a ninth flower—one Ghar’kaan wasn’t ready to remember. Her entire soulstate would've destabilized.

</details>

### **H.I.L.T.**

<details>
<summary>**Kiln Auga’thuun**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "The Broken Wall Protocol"*  
If Harth’noak is killed, Kiln removes his helmet. His silence breaks, and his control fails. What follows is not rage—it’s inevitability. He activates the Broken Wall Protocol, and the Chamber of Scars is born.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Ghar’kaan**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "Disobedience: Full Break Path"*  
If Ghar’kaan is forced to choose between Harth’noak and Kezen, and she chooses the former, her sniper becomes more than a tool—it becomes a statement. One shot. One fracture. H.I.L.T. splinters.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Kezen**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "Unspoken Contingency"*  
She knew Kiln might fracture. She wrote the seal, forged the plan. But if she had revealed it to him, would he have resisted the fall? Or would knowing he had a failsafe have broken him faster?

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Harth’noak**</summary>

#### *Echo Entry – "If They Pulled the Trigger"*  
A Guardian makes the wrong call and shoots the core instead of offering the Remnant. Harth erupts. The emotional bomb goes off—not in hate, but in heartbreak. The only ones left standing are those who never doubted him.
