# Kezen – The Necromancer of Regret
![Kezen.png](/assets/Kezen.png)
**Species**: Hive Wizard (descended from Nokris)

**Role**: Founder of H.I.L.T., Necromancer

**Visual Style**: Ritual patchwork robes with Hive stitching and etched bone charms

**Weapon / Ability Style**: Necromantic rites, soulfire puppetry


**Quote**:

> “For one second—I wasn’t alone.”



---

Overview

> A disciple of necromancy exiled from Hive traditions, Kezen formed H.I.L.T. to gather the discarded—those rejected by Sword Logic. She never sought power, only release. Where others saw heresy, she saw rebirth.

---
 **Full Bio**

Once part of a hidden sect within the Hive, Kezen was a disciple of necromantic rites.

Unlike Nokris, she never sought acclaim. She learned in silence, practiced in exile, and eventually severed herself from the Hive hierarchy altogether.

Kezen founded H.I.L.T. to reclaim what the Hive discarded: reason, restraint, and purpose.

She carries regret like a lantern—and lets it light her path.

Kezen was born of forbidden lineage—descended from Nokris, a pariah among pariahs. Raised in shadows and quiet scrutiny, she hid her necromantic ability for fear of Hive orthodoxy branding her heretic. Her gift was to return the dead not as puppets—but as echoes. And it terrified those who served the Sword Logic.

She left. She wandered. She learned. She began to stitch together a new kind of power—not from servitude or god-worship, but from fractured lives like her own.

Those who joined her didn’t kneel. They stood. Together, they became H.I.L.T.—Hive Idolized to Lost Trails.


---

**Personality**

-  Stern & Strong-Willed

- Maternal in cryptic, ritualistic ways

- Sees common power ranks as a burden

---

**Signature Traits / Battle Notes**

> Resurrects spectral Hive puppets to fight with her. Also uses weapons. Her death is canonically marked in the Chamber of Trials.

# Kiln Auga’thuun – The Fortress Blade
![Kiln.png](/assets/Kiln.png)

**Species**: Hive Knight

**Role**: Heavy Support, Tactical Interceptor

**Visual Style**: Pale blue heavy armor with glowing green veins; full white helm

**Weapon / Ability Style**: Smart-Cleavers forged in sorrow, can combine into one axe and uses solar effects based on emotion & intent.


**Quote**:

>There's an insanity in control. I have control, just within insanity.”


---

Overview

>  Kiln speaks like a philosopher and fights like a siege wall. He was once a mindless soldier, but Kezen taught him how to reflect. He speaks rarely, but with extreme, keen weight.


---
 **Full Bio**

Kiln is Kezen’s hammer, her shield, and her foundation.

A once-fallen Knight known for his brutal efficiency, Kiln defected during a siege that left his battalion in ashes.

He speaks little, acts swiftly, and believes in strength—not for conquest, but for peace.

His weapons are dual-wielded cleavers modeled after Cabal gladiators, reforged into axes by his own hand.

Kiln was H.I.L.T.'s first hammer. A warrior who began in blade and shield, fighting among Hive trenches before defecting under Kezen’s ideals.

He took interest in Cabal cleavers—not for brutality, but for their balance. He forged his Great Dane Axe: one massive weapon that splits into two.

Despite his strength, Kiln served as peacemaker, reigning in Kapaar’s chaos and anchoring the group’s brutal intent. His partnership with Kapaar was brotherly—argumentative, explosive, but unwavering.

Kiln’s legacy is etched in every fallen enemy and every soldier who saw him not as a brute—but as a bastion.

# Kapaar – The Augured Flame
![KAPAAR.png](/assets/KAPAAR.png)

**Species**: Hive

**Role**: Pyroshock Disruptor, Flamefield Control

**Visual Style**: Faded gray armor, red/green glow accents, soulfire tank on back

**Weapon / Ability Style**: “Gospel” – soulfire-modified flamethrower of his own invention


**Quote**:

> “If I laugh maniacally, it’s working!”


---

Overview

> A pyro-hive engineer with a mouth as dangerous as his weapon. Behind the chaos lies remorse, shown through his craftsmanship and isolation. He named his weapon hoping someone would finally listen to him.

---
 **Full Bio**

Kapaar is H.I.L.T.’s spark and shrapnel—a living weapon wrapped in burnt prayer.

Once a Hive boomer with no leash and no conscience, he found belonging under Kezen’s command.

He modified Cabal flamethrowers to emit soulfire, branding his enemies with heat and memory.

Kapaar often causes more damage than intended, but Kezen sees something salvageable in him—even when he doesn’t.

If Kiln was the shield, Kapaar was the wildfire. Once a Hive brute of staggering force, he fell in love with destruction—but only when it meant progress.

Where Kiln sought structure, Kapaar sought heat. He took inspiration from Cabal Incendiors and re-engineered a flamethrower fueled not by flame, but by soulfire. The result? Chaos, often uncontrollable.

Burns lace his right arm—scars he wears with pride. He calls them “Augurs,” signs that he’s seen the future and it bleeds.


He and Kiln fought more with words than weapons—but stood together every battle. Kapaar’s journal scrawls in ash:

*“Structure cools. Fire builds. You need both to make steel.”*


---

**Personality**

- Rowdy, sarcastic, chaotic

- Deeply scarred and insecure

- Loyal in reckless, unconventional ways

---

**Signature Traits / Battle Notes**

> Leaves trails of soulfire and sets zones ablaze. Explosives speak louder than words. Despite being the comic relief, he's also the emotional wildcard.

# Ghar’kaan – The Soulstone Mindbreaker
![Ghar'kaan.png](/assets/Ghar'kaan.png)

**Species**: Hive, genetically stunted Acolyte 

**Role**: Battlefield Manipulator, Psychic Disruptor

**Visual Style**: above average size acolyte,  Jagged armor in pale orange. steel accents with glowing purple soulstone in center of helmet

**Weapon / Ability Style**: Mind control, swift mobility, limited but calculated weapon use


> “I don’t need to be louder—I just need to be the last thing you remember.”

---

Overview

> Ghar’kaan doesn’t overpower—she unravels. A master of mental manipulation, she was trained to infiltrate and destabilize long before she ever picked up a weapon. Rarely flinches, and rarely loses control.
  Her bond with Kezen was deeper than loyalty—it was purpose. And her connection to Harth’noak gave her a tether to her own fading sense of self.

---
**Full Bio**

A Hive acolyte genetically blocked from becoming a wizard, Ghar’kaan adapted.
She favored range, versatility, and intelligence—shifting from thrall to tactician.
Her third eye was damaged in battle, and Kezen gifted her a crystal lens to protect and weaponize it.

The lens can subdue enemies who stare too long into its glow.

Once an acolyte bound for wizardhood, Ghar’kaan’s mutation denied her that path. She turned instead to intellect, outfitting herself with a soulfire rifle and a modified shredder.

She fought for Hiraks, then defected after his fall. Kezen saw potential in her trauma—potential she nurtured.

After a firefight damaged her third eye, Kezen gifted her a crystal-laced helmet. It glows with influence: anyone who stares risks falling under her control. She used it many times to subdue adversaries Kezen desires alive, once to avenge herself. She forced the perpetrator to end ones own life with their weapon.

To H.I.L.T., she’s a tactician. To Kezen, a confidant.

---


Personality

- Controlled and cold on the outside

- Deeply protective of those she trusts

- Avoids loud approaches when possible, prefers stealth in missions



---

Signature Traits / Battle Notes

> Master of covert operations and psychic interference. Enemies fight themselves under her influence. Never needed force—only understanding.

# Harth’noak – The Grief Engine
![Harth.png](/assets/Harth.png)

**Species**: Cursed Hive Thrall (Ogre-like mutation)

**Role**: Area Denial & Volatile Tank

**Visual Style**: Tall, corrupted flesh with rune-scarred body and glowing pale blue inner light

**Weapon / Ability Style**: Grief-powered shockwaves, Cursed Thrall command, chain-reaction eruptions



> “His scream isn’t a sound—it’s a memory shattering.”

---

**Overview**

> A towering monster fused from cursed Thrall and twisted Hive tech. Harth doesn’t speak, but he feels—and when grief hits, he detonates. Ghar’kaan is his anchor. Without her, his control is fractured.

---
 **Full Bio**

Harth’noak is an anomaly—an ogre with emotional depth forged through ritual and grief.

He doesn’t speak, but feels. When calm, he is a stone pillar. When enraged, a quaking faultline.

Kiln brings him offerings. Kapaar tempers his tone near him. And Ghar’kaan once placed her hand on his head—he let her.

He remembers that.

A cursed ogre built from the grave by Kezen herself, Harth’noak commands legions of cursed Thrall—being one in origin, just far greater.

He bears the glowing blue essence inside his skin, just like the cursed ones he leads.

Kezen considered him her most dangerous creation—and her most vulnerable. He obeys without language, expressing only through gesture and grief.

Under enough stress, Harth detonates—a catastrophic explosion that kills both guardian and ghost. The only way to prevent it is coordinated disruption.
He does not speak. But his sorrow echoes.


Final title: *The Mourner*. His pain is not just fuel. It’s memory.

- Quiet and haunted

- Fiercely loyal and protective

- good hearing, expresses & reacts via rumbles and gestures


---

**Signature Traits / Battle Notes**

> Becomes volatile under emotional pressure, unleashing a deadly grief-charged explosion that can vaporize Guardians and Ghosts alike.
