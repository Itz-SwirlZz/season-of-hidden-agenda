## **Zafe Sone Character Hub**  
Welcome to the cozy canon corner of **Zafe Sone** — a softer, alternate reality space for character reflections, sitcom shenanigans, emotional threads, and chaotic side moments. 

**Note:** Zafe Sone entries are **non-canon** and often reference real-world elements or alternate takes on characters. They’re where Harth can be a Minecraft Creeper, Kapaar grows plants, and Vanessa hugs her threadlings like plushies. These entries are designed for tone shifts, levity, personal insights, and what-ifs that *aren’t meant to affect the core timeline.*

Characters are listed individually and grouped by faction, each with their own expandable tab containing their full written Zafe Sone entries.

### **BRAVO-7**

<details>
<summary>**Vanessa Winterfield**</summary>

#### *Zafe Sone Lore Entry – "Thread-Linked"*  
Vanessa has a quiet habit of naming her threadlings—not as tools, but as companions. She doesn't control them. She invites them. Every time one returns, it brings back a memory she didn’t ask for but somehow needed. Her necklace tradition started when she was eight, long before she could cast. One octopus. Eight legs. Eight promises she’s still trying to keep.

#### *Sitcom Moment – "Thread Nap"*  
Vanessa falls asleep on the couch. A threadling curls onto her cheek and purrs. Kapaar walks by, pauses, and whispers, “Gross.” Then sits nearby to “make sure it doesn’t explode.”

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Yerk Vega**</summary>

#### *Zafe Sone Lore Entry – "The First Color"*  
He saw her eyes change to violet once. Just once. She thought no one noticed. But he did. And the next day, he left a tiny octopus charm on her desk. She never said a word, just wore it silently. That was enough.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Zakk Romletté**</summary>

#### *Sitcom Entry – "Void and Vines"*  
Zakk tries to prank Pistillum with a void-thrown threadling decoy. The flowers retaliate. No one talks about what happened to his boots.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Kaniss Romletté**</summary>

#### *Mini-Entry – "Spider Log #14"*  
"Golden Silk Orb Weavers have more discipline than most Guardians. Precision tension. Patience. Effective traps. One sleeps above my lamp. Her name is Clarity."

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Dannie Garcia**</summary>

#### *Zafe Sone Note – "Ramp Queen"*  
Vanessa once watched her build a sparrow ramp out of wreckage, then land a flip through fire. When asked why, Dannie just said, “I was bored and the fire looked flippable.”

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Harlo-9**</summary>

#### *Mini-Scene – "Shield Check"*  
Kapaar accidentally melts a bench. Harlo wordlessly replaces it with a new one. When asked how he’s so calm, he replies, “You get used to having a flamethrower roommate.”

</details>

### **NEUTRAL CHARACTERS**

<details>
<summary>**Pistillum**</summary>

#### *Folklore Entry – "The Petal Duel"*  
They say she fought the Bouquet Leader once. Neither won. The battlefield still blooms out of season.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Baylanard**</summary>

#### *Codex Log – "Shells and Silence"*  
He crafts armor like poems—layered, heavy, purposeful. Once gifted Harlo a gauntlet engraved with a line of binary. Harlo translated it a week later: "You're worth rebuilding."

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Nötivart**</summary>

#### *Echo Lore – "Void Reflection"*  
He once stood still on Gliese for three days, waiting for a star alignment no one else saw. When it passed, he said only: “Now it begins.” Then vanished.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**The Bouquet Leader**</summary>

#### *Fragmented Story – "The Eightfold Crown"*  
They wear a crown of eight flowers. Each one a memory. Each one a warning.

</details>

### **H.I.L.T.**

<details>
<summary>**Kezen**</summary>

#### *Recruitment Log – "Tools Sharpened by Purpose"*  
She chose Kiln first—not for obedience, but because he understood restraint. She let Kapaar burn because Kiln could contain him. She kept Harth as a mistake she dared to love.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Kapaar**</summary>

#### *Sitcom Entry – "Gunk Lives"*  
Kapaar adopts a dying plant. Names it Gunk. Yells at it to grow. One leaf sprouts. He declares victory.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Kiln Auga’thuun**</summary>

#### *Echo – "The Broken Wall Protocol"*  
If Harth is killed, Kiln removes his helmet. What follows isn’t rage—it’s inevitability.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Ghar’kaan**</summary>

#### *Memory Note – "Her Silence Is Armor"*  
She speaks less now. Ever since she started watching over Harth. Some silences are defense. Hers became connection.

</details>

<details>
<summary>**Harth’noak**</summary>

#### *Unspoken Entry – "Hands of Stillness"*  
He never speaks. But when he placed a flower on Gunk’s pot and backed away, Kapaar didn’t yell. He just said: “...Yeah. Okay.”
