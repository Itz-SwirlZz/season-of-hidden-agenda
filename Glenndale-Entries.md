# Signal Tower Journal – Kaniss R.
*A quiet collection of reflections from the edge of Glenndale*

---

### Entry 01 – “Silk and Static”

> *"They left a drawing. Folded it twelve times and slid it under my trap coil panel.  
Crayons. Purple and blue arcs. Me — eight limbs.  
Said I protect them."*

> *"I reinforce perimeter nets. I prevent loss vectors. I’m not… a symbol."*

> *"...but I moved the panel. Left the drawing visible.  
Only that one."*

> *"And I upgraded his gloves.  
Light-dampening mesh. He won’t notice."*

> *"...It’s fine."*

---

### Entry 02 – “In The Way”

> *"He brought down two drones. Not with malice — with Void dust."*

> *"Said they startled the kids.  
Said I needed to ‘maybe not make them screech like banshees every 4.2 seconds.’"*

> *"I calibrate by range, not by scream."*

> *"But I… watched the kids sleep easier tonight. One of them brought out chalk. Drew a line around his doorstep.  
Called it a 'Zakk Zone.' Ridiculous."*

> *"Still.  
I reprogrammed Drone-7 and Drone-9 to hum instead of screech. Frequency: 326 Hz.  
Soothing. Measured. Effective."*

> *"He’s in the way.  
Not always the wrong way."*

---

### Entry 03 – “Stitched Notes”

> *"A child taped a note to the Spiderhouse gate today."*  
> *'Can we play tag if your traps don’t chase?'*

> *"I rewrote the Arc leash radius. Narrowed it 43%.*  
*Left three empty safe zones between the coils."*

> *"They played. They screamed. Not in fear — in joy."*

> *"I watched from the signal dish. Zakk waved.  
I did not wave back."*

> *"One of the kids came back after dusk.  
She left a stuffed ghost on the porch. Its eye was missing. Threadbare.  
I reinforced the seam. Returned it with upgraded padding."*

> *"The next day… she called it ‘Miss Webby.’"*

> *"...I accepted that."*

---

### Entry 04 – “The Festival Day”

> *"Glenndale held something they called a ‘lightfall day.’ Not related to the Collapse — something... celebratory."*  
> *"Colored paper. Firecrackers. Mismatched armor paints. Unstructured chaos. Children everywhere."*  
> *"I disabled 11 traps. Zakk tampered with three before I could get to them."*

> *"One girl asked if she could paint my Arc gauntlets.  
Said mine were ‘the color of sleep.’"*

> *"...I let her. She used violet, gold, and glowberry orange."*  
> *"It doesn’t wash off. I haven’t tried."*

---

### Entry 05 – “The Smile Question”

> *"A child — Jeyven, age 6 — asked why I never smile."*

> *"I told him facial expressions were not necessary for safety protocols."*

> *"He looked disappointed.  
Said ‘Zakk smiles, and he blows things up.’"*

> *"...I said nothing."*

> *"I later adjusted my helmet’s LED feedback loop to simulate soft facial curvature."*  
> *"I wore it near the Archive Tree. Jeyven nodded once."*

> *"I’ve only used it once.  
That was enough."*

---

### Entry 06 – “A Moment of Doubt”

> *"A breach occurred. Sector Three.  
Drone-2 failed to deploy its snare coil. My coil."*

> *"Zakk took the hit. Minor burns. He told the kid to run.  
Didn’t tell me until I saw his hand shaking while flipping that dumb coin."*

> *"I rewrote 137 lines of code. Stayed up four cycles.  
It wasn’t the drone’s fault."*

> *"He left a note:  
‘You fix things that aren’t broken. That’s how I know you care.’"*

> *"I burned it.  
Not before scanning it."*

---

### Entry 07 – “The Storm Evacuation”

> *"Atmospheric readings spiked. Void lightning across the ridgeline. Power dropout risk 94.2%."*

> *"I initiated Evacuation Protocol Theta.  
The kids hesitated. Some thought it was a game."*

> *"I used my voice.  
All of it."*

> *"They moved. Quickly."*

> *"One of the older ones, Lanar, asked why I sounded afraid.  
Said I usually sound like metal. Not… human."*

> *"I told him: 'Metal doesn’t panic. Humans do. I didn’t want to lose anyone.'"*

> *"After the storm passed, they returned to the Archive Tree.  
One left a drawing of me holding a lightning rod. It said:  
‘We followed the storm spider.’"*

> *"...I reinforced the base of the Archive Tree. Just in case."*

---

### Entry 08 – “The Hidden Memorial”

> *"I never noticed it before. Carved into the back roots of the Archive Tree, hidden under moss."*  
> *"Nine names. Small ones. Curved letters. Dates too short."*

> *"Old losses. From the early days.  
Before the traps. Before the structure."*

> *"There was a rusted cloth pin beside them — shaped like a threadling. Purple-dyed.  
I recognized the stitching."*

> *"Vanessa made these. I remember her smile when she gave me mine."*

> *"I repaired the pin. Left it there.  
Then I added a name: one I remembered from an early evac failure."*

> *"Not for glory. Not for records.  
Just… so someone knew they were worth being remembered."*

# Voidnotes: Zakk R.
*A record of the quiet shadows between sarcasm, trust, and something close to home.*

---

### Entry 01 – “Staring Contest”

> *"You ever try to have a staring contest with someone who’s constantly watching motion sensors?  
You lose. Every time."*

> *"I tried anyway. Kaniss was perched on the signal tower — her favorite haunted gargoyle impression. She didn’t blink once."*

> *"I blinked twice, waved, and got the usual: cold silence and the sound of something arc-charged recalibrating just for me."*

> *"She doesn’t hate me. I checked.  
Hate requires more acknowledgment."*

> *"But she leaves gifts for kids. Fixed a jump line the other day before anyone noticed.  
And that one time the storm hit Glenndale?  
She was the first one yelling — only time I’ve seen her shout."*

> *"That’s why I do it. Not to bother her — well, not *only* to bother her.  
It’s the little cracks.  
Every once in a while, they glow."*

> *"I don't stare to win. I stare to remind her someone sees."*

---

### Entry 02 – “Conversations with Vriss”

> *"Vriss won’t shut up lately. Not out loud — in that quiet way Ghosts have when they’re judging you without blinking."*

> *"‘You know, Zakk,’ he says, ‘she doesn’t need you to fix her.’"*  
> *"And I say: ‘I’m not trying to. I just… rewire things nearby. Coincidentally.’"*

> *"He clicks. I hate when he clicks. It’s the ‘you’re doing the thing again’ noise."*

> *"Truth is, I don’t fix her.  
But I *do* recalibrate tripmines she forgets to check."*

> *"Not because I think she’ll get hurt.  
Because I know she wouldn’t care if she did."*

> *"And that scares me more than the mines ever could."*

---

### Entry 03 – “Are You Her Brother?”

> *"A kid in Glenndale asked me if I was Kaniss’s brother."*  
> *"Said we had ‘the same sharp eyes.’"*  
> *"Which is weird, because mine are obviously better."*

> *"I told her no. Then I hesitated and said ‘kind of.’  
And then I gave her a Void coin. Told her it could bounce off light and find its way home."*

> *"She tried it. It landed in mud. She said ‘it doesn’t work.’"*  
> *"I said, ‘It’s a metaphor.’"*  
> *"She said, ‘Is that like lying but fancier?’"*

> *"...I told her yeah."*

> *"She still kept the coin."*

---

### Entry 04 – “Go Tell Her”

> *"They dared me to tell her. A bunch of Glenndale kids with sticky hands and zero impulse control."*  
> *“Go tell the Spider Lady you like her!” one yelled.  
Another added, “Bet you won’t!”*

> *They don’t know I’ve died before.  
But this? This felt worse.*

> *So I walked up the slope. She was recalibrating the Archive Tree perimeter again — hadn’t looked up once in three hours. I stood there and just… watched the coil glow.*

> *I said, ‘Hey, Kaniss?’*  
> She didn’t answer. She just clicked something into place. So I tried again.*  
> *‘Hypothetically — very hypothetically — if someone liked you, would you, uh… trip them less?’*

> *She finally looked at me. Blinked once. Then said:  
‘Depends. Are they clumsy, or just asking for it?’*

> *And then she turned back to her panel like it never happened.*

> *I laughed. Too loud. Almost got zapped on the way down.*

> *I don’t think I failed.  
But I don’t think I won either.*  
> *Which is very us.*  

---

### Entry 05 – “Don’t Write This Down”

> *"Vanessa caught me sitting on top of the water tower."*  
> *"She didn’t say hi — she just threw a snack bar at my head and said, ‘You're too quiet. What broke?’"*

> *I told her nothing.  
Which is how she knew something was up.*

> *She sat beside me, kicking her feet like a kid on a ledge. Then she pulled out her journal and said, ‘This is going in the log unless you talk.’*

> *So I said:  
‘I like Glenndale. Not because it’s safe. Because it’s messy, but people *try.*’*

> *She smiled. Not the normal bright one — the *real* one. Quiet, like she knew the storm was calm for a second.*

> *Then she wrote anyway.  
I said, ‘Don’t write that down.’*

> *She said, ‘Already did. Page header: “Zakk feels stuff, and it’s weird.”’*

> *I said I hate her. She said, ‘No you don’t.’*

> *I don’t.*  

---

### Entry 06 – “She Didn’t Mean To”

> *"I was rerouting a Void capacitor around the Spiderhouse — not snooping. Just fixing. Probably improving, if we’re being honest."*

> *I slipped under the old vent port. That’s when I saw it — half-tucked under a folded cloth, half-exposed.*

> *A drawing.  
Crayon lines. Threadling arms.  
Me.*  
> *Standing next to her.*  
> *No trap coils. Just the Archive Tree behind us. And the words:  
‘Safe is when he’s here.’*

> *She didn’t mean to leave it out.  
She wouldn’t.*  
> *And I didn’t take it. Didn’t even touch it.*

> *Just looked at it.  
Then walked out like I hadn’t seen anything.*  
> *Like it wasn’t the most dangerous thing I’d ever stumbled into.*

> *I didn’t log anything else after that.*  
> *Didn’t need to.*

# 📍 Daring Dannie – Glenndale Entry

> “It wasn’t about being the fastest. It was about showing them they could go fast too.”

**Location:**  
Old Glenndale outcrop, southeast clearing — now repurposed as a makeshift sparrow ramp zone.

**Entry:**  
Long before the stunt reels, the merch, the showboating fame—Dannie Garcia spent her days in Glenndale fixing broken sparrows and turning junk piles into daredevil courses. It was here the village kids snuck past fences to watch her fly.

She didn’t mind.  
In fact, she left gaps in the fence on purpose.

Dannie wasn’t chasing adrenaline back then. She was chasing something far rarer: **permission to believe**. If a girl from a scrap village could do backflips on a dented frame, maybe the rest of them could do something impossible too.

She still visits the lot sometimes. Not to ride—but to **watch**.

---

# 📍 Harlo-9 – Glenndale Entry

> “The rust kept the memory. Every plate meant something. Especially the broken ones.”

**Location:**  
Back of the Glennstone mechanic shed. Third bench from the left—still stained with orange synth-oil.

**Entry:**  
Before he became *The Rebuilt Shield*, Harlo-9 was just Harlo—an Exo with half a memory and a full workshop to hide inside. In Glenndale, the local smiths didn’t ask questions about reboots or version counts. They just handed him tools and said, “Make it fit.”

So he did.

His shields weren’t standard-issue. They were **layered with stories**—every scorch mark and cracked weld left visible by choice. He believed that protection didn’t come from durability alone—it came from the **intention** behind the weld.

The third shield he ever built still hangs on the wall.  
Cracked. Unfinished. Perfect.

He never fixed it.  
He says it’s the one that taught him **what not to patch over**.

---

# 📍 Yerk Vega – Glenndale Entry

> “I never lost a game. Not because I cheated—because I knew who I was playing for.”

**Location:**  
Back patio of the Glenndale pub. One broken dice cup nailed to the wall, and a table still bearing an 8-legged carving.

**Entry:**  
Yerk Vega didn’t just pass through Glenndale—he **rooted** there. At night, when the rest of the fireteam drifted off to recalibration and recon, Yerk would wander to the pub, slide into the back seat, and start rolling dice.

Locals learned quickly: you didn’t play against Yerk—you played **with** him. He brought the kind of confidence that didn’t brag. The kind that smiled when others won. And the kind that *only* sharpened when stakes turned personal.

On the underside of the dice table, Vega carved a little octopus—the same symbol he wears. Eight legs, looping around a name.

Some say it’s a love story.  
Others say it’s a promise.

Yerk won’t say.  
He just tells people the game’s still on.

# 📍 Vanessa Winterfield – Glenndale Entry

> “They didn’t win the race. But they got caught in wildflowers—and that was better.”

**Location:**  
Riverbed path east of Glenndale, beneath the bending birch tree. Threadlings used to nest there.

**Entry:**  
In Glenndale, before her spells had names and her threadlings had teeth, Vanessa Winterfield used her constructs for play. Not battle—not precision. Just **joy**.

She’d send her threadlings skittering down the riverbank like tiny racers, laughing as they weaved around stones and plants. One got caught in a patch of wildflowers. It didn’t struggle—it just curled up in the petals like it had found something more important than finishing first.

Vanessa didn’t summon another.  
She just sat down beside it, scribbled in her journal, and stayed.

To this day, she calls that moment her first real victory.

And somewhere, on the edge of that river, is a rock painted with eight tiny legs and a smile.
