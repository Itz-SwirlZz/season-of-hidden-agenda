# Side Log – “Still Ours”  
*Placement: Contax Team Internal Dialogue, 3 days after the Bravo-7 exchange*

---

The mission logs had been clean, but Ezek kept reading them anyway—eyes tracing over the line where Zakk had actually written *"Ezek Ranno provided suppressive fire"* like it was normal.

War-Punisher was the first to comment.

> “They’re getting comfortable.”

Soren Vell sat on the edge of a crate, arms folded, watching a diagnostic run scroll on his HUD.  
> “It means we did something right.”

Jalen Rhoke rolled his neck. “It means they’re watching who we are, not just how we fight.”

Isaiah Merek, ever quiet, glanced up from a torn bandage he’d been rewrapping.  
> “It scared me a little. Not gonna lie.”

Derek Valen looked up from tightening his gloves.  
> “That’s because names stick. Armor peels off. But names…”

He paused, then quietly added:  
> “…names are where they cut deepest.”

Ezek leaned back, arms behind his head.  
> “Vanessa remembered mine. Not even just my name. The way she said it—like she was sketching it in her head.”

> “She probably was,” Isaiah murmured with a smile.

Kalen Drew strolled in from outside, wind-stirred and still dusted with Verdant pollen.  
> “You know what’s weird? I liked hearing mine from Vega. Sounded like he meant it.”

> “He did,” Soren said flatly. “That’s what he does. Says little. Means a lot.”

They fell into silence again. Not tense. Just thoughtful.

Then Jalen added:  
> “Even if they use our names... our callsigns are still ours.”

> “Exactly,” Derek nodded. “They didn’t strip it. They just earned another layer.”

Ezek grinned.  
> “That’s kinda poetic, man.”

Jalen snorted.  
> “Don’t get used to it.”
