“Just keep it secret! Hunters have truesight!”
“Shaxx passed a rule. Use it wrong, you get banned. Or worse… lose your badge.”
“So rather than sneak it… I make it obvious. A Thermite grenade, but… alive. Tracking. Watching.”
“You’re my psychobot, Harlo. But maybe tell Vega?”

“I’m there… I’m with you… here.”



Catalyst Lore Tab – "The Shape of a Promise":

And now… I see Guardians with her weapon. I hear it. I feel it. It was her.
I gave the Guardian a color swatch. “She liked these colors,” I said. “Give her this back… or carry it forward.”
It’s yours now. But so is she.

### Step 1: **Arrival**

**Location:** Verdant Grave perimeter – post-ambush  
**Dialogue:**
> **Vanessa:** “Oh Light—she’s still breathing—Kaniss? Kaniss, say something—”  
> **Zakk:** “Her traps... they’re still active. Don’t touch anything.”  
> **Vanessa:** “Zakk, she’s bleeding out!”  
> **Zakk:** “And *still thinking.* Look at the placements. It’s patterned. Reflexive. She was still fighting… calculating.”  
> **Vanessa (quieter):** “She laid her thoughts in traps…”

---

### Step 2: **Zakk’s Analysis**

**Objective:** Follow the Arc trap signals left behind  
**Dialogue:**
> “I’ve always mocked her prep. Overplanning. Spider-logging. But this… this wasn’t just a web. It was a failsafe. A message.”  
>  
> “Every charge she left behind fed off aggression. Pulse-reactive. Not automated—*anticipatory.*”

---

### Step 3: **Memory Anchor**

**Objective:** Ambush the fallen that cornered Kaniss.  
**Dialogue:**
> “I watched her once—trace out a firing path in silence. Said nothing, just tapped her finger against her own helmet like she was syncing her brain to an invisible score.”  
>  
> “This… this is that score. And she finished it even while bleeding.”

---

### Step 4: **Recovery Bay – Exotic Unlock**

**Dialogue:**
> **Kaniss (weakly):** “So you *listened,* for once.”  
> **Zakk:** “I did more than listen. I adapted.”  
> **Kaniss:** “Did it fit?”  
> **Zakk:** “Perfectly. But don’t let it go to your head. Your planning nearly got you killed.”  
> **Kaniss (smirking):** “Then next time, place the final pulse yourself.”  
> **Zakk (softly):** “Already did.”
