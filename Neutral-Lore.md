## Pistillum – Goddess of the Flower Fields

Pistillum once ruled the radiant domain of the Black Garden before the Vex brought its verdant splendor to ruin. In the aftermath, she retreated and reshaped a new floral sanctuary—one isolated from mechanized corruption. Though serene in appearance, her new realm is perilous to intruders, for Pistillum wields her power without mercy. She views the disrespect of nature as an unforgivable sin and punishes transgressors through a blend of botanical wrath and spectral illusion. Her presence is felt most in the Verdant Grave dungeon, where her exotics and curses test the moral alignment of Guardians.

Despite her sharp justice, Pistillum is not without elegance or symbolism. Her lore embodies balance—life's beauty and its brutality entwined like thorns around a stem. She speaks little but communicates deeply through gesture, flora, and arcane naturalism, preferring the company of overgrown silence to that of synthetic sound.

- **Height:** Small, childlike frame, no taller than Ghar’kaan’s waist

- **Mind:** Has encyclopedic recall of the dead—can recite the final thoughts of any flower that bloomed on the Crown  
- **Emotion:** Keeps a stoic mask, but small flickers of grief or joy appear in subtle gestures—tilts of the head, hand twitches, flower tugs

## Baylanard – The Reclusive Forgemind

Baylanard is a reserved Exo gunsmith who prefers to remain in obscurity, far from the likes of the Tower's politics or the prying eyes of Guardians seeking flashy gear. His workshop, rumored to be nestled in the hollowed hull of a forgotten warship, produces armor and weaponry built for endurance over elegance. Each piece he crafts is etched with functional weight—tools of purpose rather than show.

Baylanard is closely allied with Harlo-9, and those who earn Harlo’s trust may find a rare opportunity to meet the Exo smith. Despite his reclusive nature, Baylanard is not unfriendly. He simply values silence, precision, and practicality over fame. Many believe he’s undergone fewer memory resets than most Exos, clinging to fragments of a life long passed, though he never confirms or denies it.

## Nötivart – The Hollow Star

Nötivart is a void-wielding entity of such enigmatic origin that even the most devout historians question whether he was ever truly real—or if he is a conceptual being made manifest through belief and war. Said to have ruled with devastating intellect and gravitational command during the conflict on Gliese, Nötivart disappeared without a trace, leaving behind scattered symbols and fractured legends.

To those like Zakk Romletté, Nötivart is more than myth—he is a source of insight, power, and transformation. His teachings emphasize the sculpting of the void not merely as a weapon but as a reflection of internal entropy. Though no Guardian claims to have met him, those who walk his path speak of dreams shaped by black suns and stars that whisper their names. Whether man, god, or ghost, Nötivart’s legacy endures in shadows.
