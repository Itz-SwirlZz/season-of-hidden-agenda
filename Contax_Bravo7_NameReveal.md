# Side Log – “The Names We Don’t Say First”  
*Placement: Between Bravo-7 and Contax Team, Post-Operation “Splinter Bloom”*

The fire was low, crackling like it had secrets. Just outside the wrecked bunker, under a cracked moon and the scent of burnt moss.

Zakk Romletté sat cross-legged, spinning a Void mote between his fingers. Vanessa sat beside him, sketching—probably another threadling design no one would see. Vega, of course, was leaning back against the wall, arms folded, watching the Contax Team like they were puzzles.

"You know," Zakk said, "we’ve run three missions with them now. Still don’t know their names."

"They told us their callsigns," Vanessa murmured.

"Yeah. But c’mon. War-Machine? Curer? Tactical? That’s armor plating, not skin."

Derek Valen—**War-Machine**—glanced over from where he was fiddling with a torn glove. “Didn’t think it mattered,” he said. “Names slow people down.”

Vega tilted his head. “And yet you’re still here. Which means you trust us.”

A moment passed. Then Punisher—**Jalen Rhoke**—chuckled under his breath.

“One rule,” he said. “You don’t say it back until it means something.”

**Isaiah Merek** (Curer) looked up, surprised. Even **Ezek Ranno** (Bomber) turned quiet, sitting on a crate and adjusting his jacket.

War-Tactical stepped forward. "Soren Vell," he said, simply. “Now it’s on the table.”

Vanessa’s pen paused.

"...Derek Valen," added Machine, nodding.

"Isaiah Merek," said Curer. Almost too softly.

"Jalen Rhoke," muttered Punisher, rubbing his scar. “Don’t wear it out.”

"Kalen Drew," Fighter said, giving a cocky salute before punching Vega’s shoulder.

"Ezek Ranno," said Bomber. “And don’t act surprised. I still blow stuff up.”

Zakk grinned. “I feel like I just found out your class got renamed.”

Vanessa, without looking up, whispered,  
> “Names aren’t slower. They’re anchors.”

War-Machine stared at her, eyes thoughtful.

“You’re right,” he said.  
Then he looked at Vega.

“Now that we’ve said them... it’s your turn next time.”
