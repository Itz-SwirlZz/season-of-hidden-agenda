**Kezen – “Spellcaster’s Support Group”**

> “This isn’t a cult,” Kezen insisted.

“Then why are we standing in a glowing circle wearing matching gloves?” asked Kapaar.

“Ritual unity,” Kezen replied.

Kiln said nothing. He had already fused his gloves to molten ash.

Ghar’kaan nodded, but only because she thought it was funny.

Harth’noak stared at the circle until one of the candles snuffed itself out.




---

**Kiln – “Group Meditation is Not a Suggestion”**

> Kiln once led a team mindfulness exercise.

“Breathe in discipline,” he said. “Breathe out chaos.”

Kapaar started snoring.
Ghar’kaan pretended to meditate but was actually drafting threat assessments.

Kezen hovered, whispering about leyline balance.

Harth’noak… sat perfectly still. Everyone assumed he was on board—until he shouted “BOO!” and caused Ghar’kaan to reflex-fire a sniper shot into the ceiling.




---

**Kapaar – “Fireteam Hot Takes”**

> “Name one reason I shouldn’t set this corridor on fire,” Kapaar asked.

“Civilians,” said Kiln.
“Collateral,” said Ghar’kaan.
“Consequences,” said Kezen.

Harth’noak placed a single, gentle hand on Kapaar’s shoulder.

He didn’t say a word.

Kapaar sat down and wrote a poem instead.
The hallway survived.
Barely.




---

**Ghar’kaan – “Surveillance and Sass”**

> “Why do you watch us?” Kapaar asked. “To predict your mistakes,” Ghar’kaan said.

“Joke’s on you, I don’t even know my next move.”

“I’m aware.”

Kiln chuckled once. Kezen grinned behind her mask.

Harth’noak tried to hug her afterward.
She let him. For 1.3 seconds.




---

**Harth’noak – “Big Mood. Bigger Hug.”**
(Bravo-7 members involved onward.)
> “Are we okay?” Vanessa once asked, visiting from Bravo-7.

Kiln gave a neutral nod. Kezen gave her tea. Kapaar tried flirting, burned himself.

Ghar’kaan pointed silently to the corner.

Harth’noak was sitting there with a flower crown made of enemy loot, waiting.

She joined him. They didn’t talk.

Just watched the chaos unfold.

It was the most peaceful part of her week.

**Kapaar’s Debrief**

Filed, barely legibly, into Vanguard logs. Notes verified by Harlo-9.

> “Okay so!
  This place had vents. Right? Like, so many vents. I’m talkin’ flame throwers, soulfire spirals, big ol’ blast chambers!”

“So I says to Kiln, I says—‘Hey, what if we pump napalm through the pipes, light it with Taken ashes, and call it The Gospel Vent?’”

“He stared at me for eight seconds straight. Eight.”

“Then he whispered something like, ‘This is why I question divine patience.’”

“And then, Vanessa nearly dropped her journal laughing. Zakk tried to out-sass me but tripped on a spent thrall skull. Classic.”

“Point is—next time we raid something with a boiler room, I’m naming it. Kapaar’s claim. Like a mining flag. With fire.”

Here’s a H.I.L.T. sitcom-style joke lore entry titled like a failed reality show pilot. Think The Office meets Space Fireteam Dysfunction.


### **H.I.L.T. Sitcom Special (Ep.1/2) – “Fireteam Roommates”**

*Recovered footage from a Vanguard experiment in morale bonding. Immediately classified.*

*Opening Credits Theme (narrated by Ghost):*

> “Five Hive-influenced operatives. One borrowed tower apartment.
What could go wrong?

Welcome to…
***‘H.I.L.T. With It.’***

---

**Scene 1: The Chore Wheel**

**Kezen** replaces everyone’s task with “ritual upkeep.”

**Kapaar** writes “napalm therapy” in every slot.

**Kiln** removes the wheel, replaces it with silent eye contact.

**Harth’noak** eats the wheel.

**Ghar’kaan** installs cameras to “study reactions.”



---

**Scene 2: Shared Bathroom Debacle**

**Kapaar** fogged the mirror writing motivational quotes in soulfire.

**Kiln** stores his war mallet in the sink “for balance.”

**Kezen** turned the shower into a purification chamber.

**Ghar’kaan** doesn’t use the mirror. She is the mirror.

**Harth** broke the towel rack with a single tear.



---

**Scene 3: Movie Night**

**Kezen** insists on watching hive necromancy documentaries.

**Kapaar** wants to watch explosions compilation, volume 12.

**Kiln** meditates through the whole thing.

**Ghar’kaan** critiques the plot holes before the movie starts.

**Harth** falls asleep halfway through but wakes up in time for the emotional ending… and sobs.



---

**Final Scene: Group Hug Attempt**

**Kezen** blesses the circle.
**Ghar’kaan** sighs audibly.

**Kiln** resists.

**Kapaar** cannonballs in.

**Harth** hugs them all too hard.

Entire apartment collapses.

*Credits roll.*


*(Since the kids wouldn't stop pestering us to mock another episode...)*

**H.I.L.T. Sitcom Special (Ep. 2/2) – “Kapaar Gets Us Evicted (Again)”**

*Transcript from the Tower’s short-lived “Team Living Initiative.”*

---

[Cold Open]
**Ghar’kaan**: “Why is the fire alarm whispering in Hive runes?”

**Kapaar (grinning):** “That means it’s working!”

**Kiln**: [exhales quietly]

**Kezen**: “I told you not to channel ritual fire through the stove.”
Kapaar: “It was experimental toast!”


---

**Scene 1: The Cooking Catastrophe**

**Kapaar** attempts to make “explosive omelets.”

Uses grenade parts as seasoning.

Turns the kitchen into a glowing purple smoke zone.

**Ghar’kaan** tries to snipe the fire before it spreads. Hits the fridge.

**Harth’noak** attempts to eat the smoke to “neutralize the damage.”

**Kezen** calmly draws a containment glyph around the stove.

It explodes anyway.

**Kiln** walks in, sees everything, and leaves without saying a word.



---

**Scene 2: The Landlord Visit**

The landlord is a very tired Frame named **B4-RRY**.

He arrives to find:

3 soul-runes etched into the wall

A sparking Ghost fridge

A ritual circle labeled “DO NOT STEP HERE (**Kapaar**)”

Harth watering a fireproof flower


**Kapaar** offers him an omelet. It hisses. **B4-RRY** politely declines and silently hands over the eviction scroll.
**Ghar’kaan** signs it before he finishes talking.



---

**Scene 3: The Eviction Pack-Up**

**Kezen** floats her belongings out using a tether of glowing light.

**Kiln** carries everything in one hand and a book titled “Inevitable Outcomes” in the other.

**Kapaar** packs only his flamethrower, 14 goggles, and a tooth he says is “from a Vex, probably.”

**Harth** carries the potted plant, crying quietly.

**Ghar’kaan** erases all camera footage except this episode. For training purposes.


---

**Final Shot:**

The team stares at the new apartment.

It’s smaller.

Darker.

**Kapaar** whispers, “*Perfect*.”

Everyone groans in sync.


***Roll credits.***
