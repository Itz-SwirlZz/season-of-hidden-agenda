## Kezen – Final Memory Fragment

Shared with Ghar'kaan

The ritual had ended. The summoning failed. All that remained was ash.

Kezen held the shattered crystal that once protected Ghar'kaan’s third eye. Her hand trembled.

“She would’ve solved this,” she whispered. “She would’ve seen through them.”

There was no resurrection this time. Not without cost. And Kezen—she had spent every last piece of herself already.

The wind carried her whisper to the dust.

> “I was supposed to protect you.”

## Kiln – UNBENT (Personal Entry)

Etched into weapon parchment:

> “I bend for nothing.
Not the flame.
Not the weight.
Not the silence.”



Kapaar calls me the damper. The shield. The last wall.

He’s not wrong. But without walls, fire eats the village.

Let him rage. I’ll be here when the sparks fade.

## Kapaar – AUGURED (Personal Entry)

"Kiln thinks I burn too loud. Maybe I do.
But someone has to speak flame when everyone else speaks stone."

The soulfire tank hissed last night. I patched it with a cracked boneplate. Still works.

I tested the spread. It curved into an arc I didn’t expect. Beautiful.

I know I shouldn’t test it near the graves. But they don’t complain.

Not like Kiln.

He says I’ll blow myself up one day.

> Good. Let it be loud enough to wake gods.

## Ghar’kaan – TACTICAL ENTRY: “Reminder”

[Recovered from a scorched corner of her field log, ink preserved through soulfire imprint.]

Kapaar is persistent.

I’ve been repairing the scope for two hours and he’s still circling like I owe him a flame snack or a hug.

“You should pet him,” he says. “Harth likes you.”

He says it like Harth is a domesticated beast instead of a grief-wrapped warhead.

The truth?

Harth does remember me. The way his glow flickered when I approached. The way he didn’t brace or flinch.

That silence? It wasn’t fear. It was knowing.

Still… I left a ration cube near his den this morning.

No sound. No growl. Just a soft thrum when I walked away.

> Kapaar asked if he purred.
 I told him no.
 I lied.

## Harth’noak – Internal Echo

The thrall around him clawed at air. Frenzied. Uncoordinated.

But Harth stood still.

He remembered her hand—Ghar’kaan’s—resting on his chestplate.
He remembered stillness.
He remembered not being a weapon.

Then the gunfire came.

Harth’s glow brightened.

> His roar cracked the dead stone of the chamber.



Not for Kezen.
Not for the Hive.

> For the one who touched him with no fear.
